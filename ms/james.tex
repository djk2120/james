\section{Introduction}

Trees face emerging climate change risk globally \citep{allen2010,anderegg2013b}.
Understanding vegetation response is a high priority, both for discerning climate impacts and for modeling feedbacks to the carbon and hydrological cycles.
In addition to stress from soil moisture drought, vegetation is susceptible to increasing atmospheric transpiration demand \citep{restaino2016,novick2016b}.
Increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) have occurred with warming \citep{ficklin2017,seager2015}, and are associated with impacts on vegetation \citep{williams2013,mcdowell2015}.
Significant uncertainty remains regarding how vegetation will respond to changes in hydroclimate within Earth System Models, feeding back onto the carbon cycle as vegetation mediates carbon uptake \citep{dekauwe2017,friedlingstein2014}.


Plant water stress parameterizations are important in Earth System Models, as they define vegetation regulation of surface fluxes (photosynthesis, transpiration) to water fluctuations.
Vegetation water use strategies also modulate carbon uptake, creating a critical coupling between the Earth System's carbon and hydrological cycles \citep{green2017}.
Drought stress parameterizations (functions which relate simple metric of soil moisture status to leaf gas exchange) are widely used to define the response of stomatal conductance to vegetation water status that is used to attenuate transpiration, photosynthesis, and root water uptake with drying.
The dynamics of water stress in models have broad effects on critical land surface processes \citep{joetzjer2014}.
On diurnal timescales, water stress parameterizations influence the partitioning of latent versus sensible heat with effects on surface temperature \citep{bonan2014}.
On longer timescales vegetation water use strategies regulate the global carbon and water cycles \citep{dekauwe2015}.

Many recent studies have aimed at advancing the representation of water flow through the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum (SPAC) in land models \citep{xu2016,christoffersen2016,sperry2017}.
Explicit modeling of water flow through the SPAC adds complexity, but is consistent with evidence of dynamic regulation of vegetation water use in response to both soil and atmospheric drying \citep{sperry2015}.
Furthermore, via Darcy's Law, SPAC models have a robust physical basis.
SPAC models involve new parameters, which presents new challenges \citep{drake2017}, but plant hydraulic trait information is available \citep{kattge2011,anderegg2015a}, providing guidance on parameter estimation.   and can be informative of forest vulnerability to drought \citep{choat2012}.
Likewise vegetation water status observations are available at a scale that is directly relevant to model development \citep{konings2016,grant2016} and can be used to validate model results \citep{momen2017,konings2017b}.

The empirical representation of vegetation water stress in the Community Land Model (CLM) and other land surface models is a known deficiency, with implications for the representation of the dry/wet season in tropical rainforests \citep{powell2013,ukkola2016}.

In this study, we develop a  plant hydraulic implementation within the recently released CLM version 5 (CLM5), based on hydraulic theory, which we refer to as the 'Plant Hydraulic Stress' (PHS) configuration. We analyse the dynamics of the new PHS model  using site-level simulations that replicate the Caxiuan\~a, Brazil through-fall exclusion experiment \citep{fisher2006}.

Advancing the representation of the SPAC introduces the representation of vegetation water potential (discretized into leaf, stem and root elements) into the CLM, as well as an explicit representation of water supply, from the soil through the vegetation substrate. Transpiration is attenuated with drought stress according to vegetation water status, capturing dynamic vegetation water use regulation. These changes have numerous implications, including 


1. Leaf water potential serves as an improved metric for water status (compared to soil water or soil matric potential), since it reflects vegetation sensitivity to both soil and atmospheric drying, while serving as a diagnostic for excessive xylem tension and cavitation risk. 

2. Modeling  and plant hydrodynamics provides a framework for representing hydraulic redistribution \citep{lee2005} 

3. Modeling vegetation water potential allows improved connection to remote sensing observations (e.g. Vegetation Optical Depth) \citep{konings2016}. 

4. Further, root water potential can be used to predict gradient-based root water uptake based on Darcy's law, replacing the previous empirical transpiration partitioning heuristic.  This provides the means to vary, for example, the mean depth of extraction with changing soil water conditions.

5. The new model can represent a range of water use strategies, improving the connection between plant carbon allocation decisions and water availability.



SAY IN WHICH SECTION WE WILL FINE EACH PART

To assess the new model formulation, we carried out site-level simulations at Caxiuan\~a National Forest in Brazil, which features a critical biome (terra-firme moist tropical evergreen forest).  Starting in 2001, a plot at this site was subjected to an approximately 50\% percent precipitation through-fall exclusion.  Due to the large drop in soil moisture at the precipitation exclusion site, we expect and observe \citep{fisher2007} significant vegetation regulation of transpiration and photosynthesis.

In this paper we 
1. Introduce the PHS theory and implemention in the CLM
2. Analyze the dynamics of modeled water stress, root water uptake and soil moisture profiles. 
3. Compare PHS to the behaviour of the default  CLM water stress configuration.
4. Discuss the benefits and limitations of the new model.

%  MODEL DESCRIPTION

\section{Model Description}

%Photosynthesis
\subsection{Photosynthesis}
\label{sect:A}
    The CLM5 photosynthesis model is described in \citet{bonan2011}, \citet{thornton2007},
    and \citet{oleson2013}.Photosynthesis is defined in three regimes: Rubisco-limited, light-limited, and export-limited 
    following \citet{farquhar1980} and \citet{harley1992}.The implementation extends \citet{sellers1996a,sellers1996b} with 
    co-limitation following \citet{collatz1991}. 
    
    CLM5 photosynthesis, in its default configuration, is a two-big-leaf model, with a sunlit and shaded leaf for each plant functional type \citep{thornton2007, dai2004, oleson2013}. 
    The canopy fluxes module iterates the solution for leaf temperature to satisfy the leaf surface energy balance, while environmental conditions are evolving.
    Within this, the photosynthesis module further iterates to solve for inter-cellular CO$_2$ concentration, balancing stomatal flux of 
    CO$_2$ with photosynthetic assimilation flux of CO$_2$.
    

%Stomatal Conductance
\subsection{Stomatal Conductance}
\label{sect:gs}
    CLM5 implements the Medlyn stomatal conductance model, which reconciles the empirical and optimal approaches to modeling 
    stomatal conductance \citep{medlyn2011}. 
    Stomatal conductance of CO$_2$ is thus directly related to net photosynthesis ($A_n$), CO$_2$ concentration at the leaf surface 
    ($C_a$), and the square root of the vapor pressure deficit near the leaf surface ($\sqrt{D}$).
    \begin{equation}
    g_s=g_0+\left(1+\dfrac{g_1}{\sqrt{D}}\right)\dfrac{A}{C_a}
    \end{equation}
    The model features two parameters $g_0$ ($\mu$mol / m2 / s) and $g_1$ (kPa$^{0.5}$). 
    The $g_0$ parameter is minimum stomatal conductance, representing cuticular and epidermal losses (small). 
    The $g_1$ parameter relates to the marginal water cost guiding the optimization of carbon assimilation. These parameters are plant functional type dependent.
    
    The Medlyn model, derived from stomatal optimization theory, predicts stomatal conductance to maximize assimilation relative to water costs ($A-\lambda E$), 
    but does not resolve concurrent limitations to stomatal conductance associated with drought conditions.   These water stress factors (in our case, $f_w$), are used to represent stomatal and non-stomatal limitation not captured by the leaf-level stomatal conductance model (which can be thought of as a prediction of maximum stomatal conductance in these cases). To represent soil drought, and its impact on diffusive fluxes, land surface models typically include a `water stress factor'($f_w$, dimensionless, 0 to 1, formerly $\beta_t$). Uncertainty remains within the literature for how to apply water stress factors to photosynthesis and/or stomatal conductance. 
    \citep{zhou2013,novick2016a,sperry2015}.
    
    In CLM, $f_w$ multiplies the rate of maximum carboxylation ($V_{\text{cmax}}$) as described in \citet{oleson2013}. Other models opt for soil-moisture based stomatal limitation (linking the stomatal conductance model slope parameter to soil moisture), however,
    \cite{lin2018} found that only $g_0$ was sensitive to soil moisture (and not $g_1$).
    \cite{zhou2013} suggest that changes in assimilation tend to exceed those predicted by modulating $g_1$ with soil moisture, but could be captured by changing $V_{\text{cmax}}$.
    Other field studies, however, suggest that $V_{\text{cmax}}$ does not change with drought, whereby modeled $V_{\text{cmax}}$ instead may implicitly account for mesophyll conductance changes \citep{flexas2004}.
    
    In PHS, we opt for a simplified form of this stress approach, which seems to be consistent with field observations \citep{lin2018}. Prognostic water stress ($f_w$, ranging from 0-1) attenuates stomatal conductance indirectly via multiplication of $V_{\text{cmax}}$. Water stress then lowers assimilation, which is coupled to stomatal conductance ( \citep{medlyn2011}).
    
    $f_w$ is modeled here as a function of leaf water potential ($\psi_{leaf}$) (see Section \ref{sect:demand}), with stress increasing as $\psi_{leaf}$ becomes more negative.
    This reflects the concept of hydraulic safety, with vegetation avoiding excessive xylem tension associated with risk of cavitation.
    
    Utilizing leaf water potential adopts a framework where stomatal conductance optimized for carbon gain is concurrently limited by hydraulic constraints \citep{novick2016a}. As a result, low soil water (bottom-up stress) can induce leaf moisture stress due to limited water supply while high atmospheric VPD can also induce leaf moisture stress by propagating a drying into the xylem (top-down stress).
    
    
     Much recent work has focused on alternative constraints on plant hydrodynamics, especially in response to drying soils \citep{manzoni2013b,novick2016a,zhou2014}.
    This includes how plants manage the risk of cavitation associated with increasing xylem tension \citep{sperry1998}.
    \citep{sperry2017}, for example, argue that theory based on hydraulic costs (define) could be used instead of optimizing of $A-\lambda E$.  
    Otherwise, the marginal water cost might be adjusted based on  soil water status  by adjusting $\lambda$ or Medlyn $g_1$ \citep{manzoni2013b}, but this may underestimate drought effects on photosynthesis *expand on this-RF*\citep{zhou2013,lin2018}.
    A hybrid approach, combines stomatal optimization with hydraulic constraints and/or
    so-called non-stomatal limitation, where stress attenuates $V_{\text{cmax}}$ or mesophyll conductance (both of which feed back through photosynthesis to lower stomatal conductance) \citep{egea2011,novick2016a}. [*link this back to which options are used in PHS -RF*]

    
% Plant Hydaulics
\subsection{Plant Hydraulic Stress (PHS)}
  The PHS model within CLM5 uses hydraulic (Darcy's) law and a corresponding electrical circuit analogy (Figure \ref{circuit}), to model the flow of water through the SPAC. The hydraulic framework is used to diagnose water stress associated with increasing xylem tension
  and to calculate the root water uptake in each of (in this case) 20 vertically discretized soil layers.

  \begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=9pc]{../figs/circuit.pdf}
     \caption{Plant hydraulic circuit analog schematic}
     \label{circuit}
  \end{figure}

%Hydraulic schematic and segmentation
  \subsubsection{Hydraulic schematic and segmentation}
  PHS solves for the set of SPAC vegetation water potential values ($\psi_{\text{root}}$, $\psi_{\text{stem}}$, $\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}$, $\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}$ ) that matches water supply (root water uptake) to water demand (transpiration), while maintaining continuity of water flow throughout the SPAC. Segmentation and other model design decisions followed a preference for a simplified implementation that whenever possible conformed to existing CLM model structure.
  
  At each node in the circuit diagram in Figure \ref{circuit} we model water potential, and, between nodes, we resolve the flux of water. The choice of nodes for segmentation is designed to take advantage of field-measured hydraulic traits and to allow for differences in segment parameterizations \citep{simonin2015, sperry2015}. As in other versions of the CLM,  PHS uses vertically discretized soil layers and a two-layer (sunlit vs. shaded) canopy.  Water uptake from the different soil layers is assumed to operate in parallel;  a typical assumption justified by higher resistance in lateral versus central roots (e.g. Williams et al. 2001). We further separate resistance through the soil matrix from the resistance through the root tissue \citep{williams1996}. 
  Specifics on the parameterization of conductance for each segment are provided in Appendix B.1.

%Water Supply
    \subsubsection{Water supply}
    \label{sect:supply}
    Water supply is modeled via Darcy's Law, where flow of water ($q$) is the product of the path hydraulic conductance ($k$) and the gradient in water potential (accounting for changes in gravitational potential).  Equation \ref{eq:darcy} represents the flow from a generic node 1 to node 2. 
    
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{equation}
     \label{eq:darcy}
     q = -k\left(\psi_2 - \psi_1 - \rho g \Delta z\right)
     \end{equation}
     \end{linenomath*}
    
    PHS does not represent plant tissue water storage (or capacitance, using the electrical circuit analogy).  Capacitance significantly complicates the water potential solution \citep{celia1990} and is challenging to parameterize \citep{bartlett2016}. However, buffering of water stress provided by tissue water storage could potentially be important especially on sub-daily timescales \citep{meinzer2009,epila2017}, whereby its inclusion may be warranted in future model generations.

     Vegetation segment conductance is modeled following empirical xylem vulnerability curves \citep{tyree1989}, where segments lose conductance with increasing xylem tension related to cavitation and embolism \citep{holbrook2001}. The vulnerability curves model loss of conductance relative to maximum conductance using two parameters: $c_k$, a sigmoidal shape-fitting parameter, and $p_{50}$, the water potential at 50\% loss of segment conductance (following \cite{gentine2016}). 
     
     Both $c_k$ and  $p_{50}$ can be estimated from field experiments \citep{sack2002},  and $p_{50}$ is available in the TRY trait database \citep{kattge2011}. Parameterization based on $p_{50}$ aligns with the call for a transition to models that use a wider range of plant functional trait data in their parameterization \citep{anderegg2015a}. The loss of xylem conductivity is based on lower terminal water potential ($\psi_1$) as is typical in other simplified models \citep{xu2016}, but 
     may underestimate the integrated loss of conductivity \citep{sperry2015}. 
         
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{equation}
     \label{eq:vulnerability}
     k = k_{\text{max}} \, 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_1}{p_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
     \end{equation}
     \end{linenomath*}
     
     PHS models root, stem, and leaf tissue conductances according to equation \ref{eq:vulnerability}. The parameterization of $k_{\text{max}}$ varies by hydraulic segment (see details in Appendix B1). The conductance across the soil matrix to the root surface follows \citet{williams2001} and \citet{bonan2014} and estimates a characteristic distance between the bulk soil and the root surface, to facilitate length-scaling of soil conductivity. Bulk soil resistivity is based on \citet{clapp1978} as described in \citet{oleson2013}. Further details are provided in Appendix B1.
    
%Water demand
    \subsubsection{Water demand}
    \label{sect:demand}
    
    Vegetation water demand and stomatal regulation is based on the Medlyn stomatal conductance model (see Section \ref{sect:gs}), which we adjust using the water stress factor $f_w$. 
    As discussed earlier, $f_w$ is based on leaf water potential \citep{klein2014}, and multiplies $V_{\text{cmax}}$, thus attenuating photosynthesis, and thus also stomatal conductance and transpiration.
    
     As leaf water potential declines (because of transpiration) and xylem tension increases, transpiration is attenuated relative to its maximal value.  The maximum transpiration ($E_{\text{sun,max}}$, $E_{\text{shade,max}}$) is defined as the value that results from Medlyn stomatal conductance in the absence of water stress (achieved by setting $f_w=1$). The fraction of maximum transpiration is modeled with a two-parameter sigmoidal function (Equation \ref{eq:demand}). 
     
    
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{eqnarray}
     \begin{aligned}
     \label{eq:demand}
     E_{\text{sun}}     &= E_{\text{sun,max}} \, 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}} \\
     E_{\text{shade}} &= E_{\text{shade,max}} \, 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
     \end{aligned}
     \end{eqnarray}
     \end{linenomath*}
    
     Where $\psi_{50}$, is the leaf water potential at 50\% loss of transpiration and $c_k$ is a sigmoidal shape-fitting parameter.

    
    We define $f_w$ as the ratio of attenuated to maximal stomatal conductance (Equation \ref{eq:stress}).  Maximum stomatal conductance ($g_{\text{s,sun,max}}$, $g_{\text{s,shade,max}}$) is computed as the stomatal conductance in the absence of water stress, i.e. $f_w=1$.  The attenuated stomatal conductance ($g_{\text{s,sun}}$, $g_{\text{s,shade}}$) is then the stomatal conductance associated with the PHS module water flow solution, which matches vegetation water supply with vegetation water demand 
    (Section \ref{sect:solution}).
    
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{eqnarray}
     \begin{aligned}
     \label{eq:stress}
     f_{\text{w,sun}}         &= \dfrac{g_{\text{s,sun}}}{g_{\text{s,sun,max}}} \\
     f_{\text{w,shade}}     &= \dfrac{g_{\text{s,shade}}}{g_{\text{s,shade,max}}} \\
     \end{aligned}
     \end{eqnarray}
     \end{linenomath*}
    
     Whereas the water supply parameters (see Section \ref{sect:supply}) relate to hydraulic traits often measured in the field, the hydraulic demand parameters $\psi_{50}$ and $c_k$ reflect the emergent property of hydraulic limitations to transpiration and must be empirically derived (WHAT ABOUT PLC CURVES?).
     
     CLM also features two empirical stomatal control parameters, which are the soil matric potentials where stomata are either fully closed ($\theta_{wilt}$) or fully open  ($\theta_{crit}$)  (see Section \ref{sect:btran}). Recent modeling studies have proposed different forms of relationship between stomatal regulation with water stress \citep{sperry2017,xu2016,christoffersen2016} and thus this representation remains the topic of active research . 

%PHS solution
    \subsubsection{PHS solution}
    \label{sect:solution}
    
    PHS solves for the set of vegetation water potential values ($\psi$) that matches water supply (root water uptake) to water demand (transpiration), while satisfying continuity across the four water flow segments (soil-to-root, root-to-stem, stem-to-leaf, and leaves-to-transpiration). At each time step, PHS computes the flux divergence $f$ (representing the mismatch of flow in and out of each segment for a given set of vegetation water potential values $\psi_i$, and iteratively updates $\psi$ until convergence is reached in terms of divergence, $f\to0$.
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} 
    \psi = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \psi_{\text{sun}} \\ 
    \psi_{\text{shade}} \\ 
    \psi_{\text{stem}} \\ 
    \psi_{\text{root}}            
    \end{array} \right]
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    f\left(\psi\right) = \left[ 
    \begin{array}{c}
    E_{sun}-q_{sun}\\
    E_{shade}-q_{shade}\\
    q_{sun}+q_{shade}-q_{stem}\\
    q_{stem}-\sum_{j=1}^n{q_{root,j}}
    \end{array} \right]
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    A = \dfrac{df}{d\psi}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}    
    
    While $\left|f\right|>0$
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:iter}
    \Delta\psi &=A^{-1}f\left(\psi_i\right) \\
    \psi_{i+1}  &= \psi_i + \Delta\psi
    \end{aligned} \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}    
    
    The numerics are tractable because $f$ has analytical derivatives and $A$ (a 4x4 matrix with six null entries) is easy to invert when well-conditioned. Supply and demand converge, because transpiration demand decreases with more negative leaf water potentials and supply increases with more negative leaf water potentials. Within a set of PHS iterations (\ref{eq:iter}), transpiration is assumed to be linear with $f_w$.
    
    The PHS loop is nested within iterations for intercellular CO$_2$ concentration and leaf temperature. The non-linear relationship between $f_w$ and transpiration is resolved through iteration for converging $f_w$ alongside intercellular CO$_2$. Details on the numerical implementation are provided in Appendix Section B.1.

\section{Water stress factor, SMS vs. PHS}
\label{sect:btran}
    PHS alters the transpiration beta function ($\beta_t$, colloquially BTRAN ,Equation \ref{bt:1}), SAY WAHT IT IS which is the phenomenological soil water stress function in used in prior versions of CLM, as described in \citet{oleson2013}. Because the name $\beta_t$ is associated with this specific plant hydrodynamics representation, we opt to rename the variable to the water stress factor $f_w$. Throughout this paper we refer to the original CLM plant hydrodynamics framework as SMS (soil moisture stress), as compared to the newer implementation described here, PHS (plant hydraulic stress). We adopt this terminology (in lieu of CLM4.5 vs. CLM5), because SMS is still deployable with CLM5.   In this section we present the SMS version of $f_w$ and outline the differences as compared to PHS
    
    With PHS, we interpret $f_w$ as a drought safety mechanism, attenuating stomatal conductance to avoid excessive xylem tension associated with very negative leaf water potential. As such, $f_w$ is parameterized as a function of prognostic leaf water potential. With SMS, $f_w$ is calculated based on soil matric potential, as a root-fraction weighted average potential departure from an empirical soil layer wilting factor (Equation \ref{bt:1}). Recent studies suggest that the SMS parameterization introduces model bias in turbulent fluxes \citep{bonan2014} and contributes to unrealistic drought response of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance \citep{powell2013}.
    
    In SMS, the variable $f_w$ is unitless, ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 corresponding to no water stress, and 0 corresponding to fully water stressed. It is calculated based on a root-fraction weighted average of soil layer wilting factor ($w_i$), which is a bounded linear function of soil water potential ($\psi_i$) relative to PFT parameters defining the soil potential with stomates fully open ($\psi_{o}$) and fully closed ($\psi_{c}$), among the soil layers $i=1,...\,,n$. Note that root fraction ($r_i$) sums to 1, by definition.
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} f_w = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{r_iw_i}
    \label{bt:1}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{bt:2}
    w_i=0 \leq \dfrac{\psi_i-\psi_{c}}{\psi_{o}-\psi_{c}} \leq 1
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    

\subsection{Root water uptake in SMS vs. PHS}
    Such parameterizations (WHICH ONES?) have primarily been examined with application to stomatal conductance, but they are also used to define vegetation soil water extraction. Each timestep, the transpiration flux solution must be distributed among the vertically discretized soil layers. In the SMS framework, the transpiration sink is partitioned by layer according to the soil layer wilting factor and root fraction. 
    
    In both stress parameterizations, $f_w$ multiplies $V_{\text{cmax}}$ to attenuate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance with soil water stress. With SMS, it is also directly used for modeling vegetation water extraction from the soil column. The total transpiration ($T$) is partitioned among the soil layers based on the $f_w$ wilting factor. Within each soil layer, the contribution to total transpiration ($q_i$) depends on the layer root fraction and wilting factor, normalized by $f_w$:

    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{bt:4}
    q_i = \dfrac{r_i w_i}{f_w}T
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    Contrary to the heuristic SMS parameterization, the PHS implementation adopts a physically-based hydraulic framework, where the root water uptake ($q_i$) is the product of the hydraulic conductance ($k_i$) and the gradient in water potential (-$\Delta\psi$) driving the flow, i.e. obeying Darcy's law. That gradient is the difference between the root water potential ($\psi_{\text{root}}$) and the layer soil water potential ($\psi_i$), minus changes in gravitational potential, following Darcy's law.
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
    q_i &= -k_i \Delta\psi \\
    \Delta\psi &= \left(\psi_{\text{root}}-\psi_{i}-\rho g \Delta z\right)
    \label{phs:sink}
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    For comparison between SMS and PHS, we recast (\ref{bt:4}) into the hydraulic framework: defining $T_{\text{max}}$, such that: $T = f_w T_{\text{max}}$ to replace $T$ in (\ref{bt:4}), and replacing $w_i$ in (\ref{bt:4}) with the formula from (\ref{bt:2}).
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:btrwu}
    q_i = \dfrac{T_{\text{max}}}{\psi_{o}-\psi_{c}} r_i \left(\psi_i-\psi_{c} \right)
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    This yields SMS analogs for the hydraulic conductance and gradient terms of Equation \ref{phs:sink}.
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
    k_i &= r_i \, \dfrac{T_{max}}{\psi_{o}-\psi_{c}} \\
    \Delta\psi &=  \psi_{c}-\psi_i \\
    \mbox{constrained by:} \qquad
    \Delta\psi &=
    \begin{cases}
    0                          & \text{if } \psi_i<\psi_{c}  \\
    \psi_{c}-\psi_{o} & \text{if } \psi_i>\psi_{o}
    \label{kb}
    \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}\end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}

   We use this formulation to discuss some of the implications for root water uptake from the former SMS parameterization of water stress (Equation 15).
   
   
    
    \subsection{Constant pulling potential}
    With SMS, that gradient is defined for each soil layer as the difference between the soil water potential in that layer ($\psi_i$) and a constant parameter, the soil water potential when stomata are fully closed ($\psi_{c}$). This parameter serves as the vegetation ``pulling'' potential for calculating the soil transpiration sink.
    
    Using a constant wilting point is inconsistent with extensive evidence from the field of dynamic vegetation water potential, and cohesion tension theory (CITATIONS NEEDED) driving the transpiration flow. Likewise the values for $\psi_{c}$ are quite negative, (-2.5 MPa for broadleaf evergreen tropical, BET, forests). \cite{fisher2006} measured midday stem potential consistently higher than -0.5 MPa during the wet season, and on average -1.69 and -1.53 MPa during the dry season in the control and exclusion plots, respectively.
    
    \subsection{Conductance dynamics}
    In SMS, in lieu of dynamic vegetation water potential, intra-day SMS soil sink dynamics derive from a highly variable conductance (CLARIFY).    As inferred in Equation \ref{kb}, SMS conductance is modeled as a function of $T_{max}$, and three constant parameters.    $T_{max}$ is highly dynamic, responding to the diurnal course in transpiration demand.    This is inconsistent with general principles of porous media flow, where conductivity is a function of the hydraulic architecture and its wetted status.    Likewise, this representation of conductance does not represent the characteristic phenomenon where vessels lose conductance with drying.
      
    \subsection{No dependence on belowground carbon allocation}
    As is typical in water stress parameterizations, the SMS conductance is scaled by layer using an area basis, here using the relative vertical root fraction is used. With PHS, an absolute measure of root biomass is used (see Appendix Equation \ref{eq:rai}), so that the belowground water cycle interacts with carbon allocation to the roots. An absolute measure better conforms with the physics of porous media flow and better responds to varying carbon allocation strategies. For example, with SMS, if root mass doubles in every soil layer, the root access to water remains unchanged.

    \subsection{Lacks penalties for extraction from depth}
    Both PHS and SMS account for the effect of decreasing root area with depth (PHS, root area; SMS, root fraction), but PHS implements two other penalties for extracting water from deep in the soil column that are missing from SMS. The first is minor, but water extracted from depth must overcome gravity, amounting to about 0.01 MPa per meter in depth. This is missing from SMS and included with PHS.  Likewise, SMS ignores the fact that hydraulic conductance is generally taken to scale with the inverse of conducting length. Deeper roots feature longer root tissue conducting length, and root spacing within the soil is less dense, requiring longer conducting distances across the soil matrix.In PHS, both these processes result in diminished hydraulic conductance (UNCLEAR).

    \subsection{Constraints}
    With SMS, the gradient in water potential is constrained between 0 and the range of soil potential between parameters for stomata fully open and closed (Equation \ref{kb}). The upper constraint caps the gradient in water potential when soil potential reaches the value for stomata fully open ($\psi_o$=-0.65 MPa for BET). Darcy's Law predicts that the gradient in water potential would continue to increase until saturation matric potential. The lower constraint caps the gradient in water potential at zero, disallowing negative gradients. However, reversed water fluxes, caused by positive gradients in water potential from root to soil, have been observed in the field \citep{burgess1998}. Both constraints are eschewed with PHS.

\section{Experiment Description}
All four simulations in this paper use the same development version of CLM5 (development version r270, https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/releases/tag/clm4\textunderscore 5\textunderscore 18\textunderscore r270).

The four simulations are used to assess the impact of the plant hydrodynamics model (PHS vs. SMS) on a through-fall experiment (i.e., with either ambient or 60\% through-fall excluded), with all other model components and forcing shared. Simulations are run offline (uncoupled from an active atmospheric model), spanning from 2001 through 2003, utilizing the satellite phenology (SP) mode of CLM5 in which vegetation state (LAI, canopy height) is prescribed and biogeochemistry is inactive. All simulations start from the same initial conditions, which are obtained from a 9-year spin-up that repeats the PHS/Ambient simulation three times. To avoid duplication, descriptions of site characteristics, forcing data, and observational sap flux, can be found in \cite{fisher2007}.

Selected parameter values concerning vegetation hydrodynamics are presented in Table 1. All other parameters use the default values associated with the r270 version of CLM5. Informed by \cite{fisher2008}, we tuned soil hydraulic parameters and through-fall exclusion rates to reasonably capture the observed soil water dynamics (\cite{fisher2007} Figure 4), Supplementary Figure \ref{top3m}. Likewise, we tuned $k_{max}$ and $g_1$ parameters to improve the fit to sap flux observations in the ambient simulation. The object of this paper is to present the dynamical impact of PHS to clearly describe model functionality. Model skill and parameter sensitivity will be assessed in follow-up studies.

\section{Results}  
\subsection{Vegetation water potential}

    PHS introduces prognostic vegetation water potential to CLM at four locations within the plant structure: at the root, stem, shaded leaf, and sunlit leaf.
    Under ambient conditions, 2003 dry season (September-October-November) model average sunlit leaf water potential is -1.65 MPa at midday (local time 12-14h, Figure \ref{fig:vwp}a)The midday pressure drop is concentrated between $\psi_{root}$ and $\psi_{stem}$, representing the root collar and upper stem, respectively.
    Under TFE, model midday leaf water potential decreases to -2.31 MPa (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}b). 
    Partitioned among the segments of the SPAC, the change in leaf water potential (totaling -0.66MPa) due to TFE is:
    -0.44MPa soil potential,
    -0.66MPa soil-to-root,
    +0.45MPa root-to-stem, and 
    -0.001MPa stem-to-leaf.
    This comports with previous evidence that seasonal changes in hydraulic resistance are larger belowground \citep{fisher2006}.

\subsection{Stress factor}

Average midday stress values from the two models are comparable during the 2003 dry season (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}).
Under ambient conditions, 0.59 and 0.54 for SMS and PHS, respectively.
With TFE, 0.16 and 0.21, respectively.
While the SMS stress factor has minimal diurnal variability (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}a),
PHS features increased stress at midday (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}b), tracking the drop in leaf water potential (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}b,c).
Likewise, the PHS stress factor responds to both soil moisture and VPD (Figure \ref{fig:stress2}c,d), while SMS responds only to soil moisture (Figure \ref{fig:stress2}a,b).






\subsection{GPP and Transpiration}
    In Figure \ref{fig4}, we plot the diurnal cycle of the stress factor averaged over the 2003 dry season (SON) (I am not a big fan of sentences in Figure we show, better to say what ahppens and then refer to figure).
    Drivers of the stress function are examined in Figure \ref{fig:vpd}.
    To highlight the response of stress to VPD, we subsetted data according to downwelling solar radiation, which also influences stress.
    Data are selected with downwelling solar radiation between 400 and 425 W/m2, which corresponds to 775 half-hour timesteps.
    For the TFE simulations, (Figure \ref{fig:vpd}c,d), we additionally exclude data from 2001, because TFE was not initiated until November 2001, leaving 515  timsteps.
    Data are subdivided into terciles based on soil water (within each plot), and colored accordingly.
    The terciles are defined for each simulation in Table 2.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
    

\subsection{Hydraulic conductance}
    In Figures \ref{fig:cond} and \ref{fig:cond2}, we compare conductance values derived from the PHS and SMS implementations.
    With SMS, $k$ is not explicitly modeled, so instead we infer $k$, 
    by dividing root water uptake $q_i$, by $\Delta\psi$ as defined in Equation \ref{kb}.
    We interpret the constraint that $\Delta\psi$ be greater than or equal to zero to mean 
    that conductance is zero in non-conforming cases, which we extend to $k=0$ when $\Delta\psi<\text{1 kPa}$.
    For our analyses, we consider only points when transpiration is greater than 4 W/m2, which improves the tractability of inferring conductance,
    given that SMS root water uptake is precluded absent transpiration (REPHRASE). 
    
    For Figure \ref{fig:cond}a,b, conductance is plotted from Soil Layer 3 (spans from 6 to 12 cm below ground),
     for all points during 2003 when transpiration is greater than 4 W/m2 (n=7752).
    For Figure \ref{fig:cond2}a,b, conductance is averaged daily, subject to the same restrictions.
    Average intra-day standard deviation is reported for FMA, by which we calculate a daily standard deviation of complying points, and report the average over the 89 days.


\subsection{Root water uptake}
    Vertical profiles of the rate of root water uptake are presented in Figures \ref{fig7}a and \ref{fig8}a, averaged over SON and FMA, respectively.
    This is plotted as average cumulative rate of root water uptake, starting at depth (8.6 meters).
    Time series of total root water uptake are also provided (Figs \ref{fig7}b,c, \ref{fig8}b,c).
    We plot total cumulative water extracted from near the surface over time in Figures \ref{fig7}b and \ref{fig8}b, 
    accompanied by that extracted from depths beyond 20 centimeters in Figures \ref{fig7}c and \ref{fig8}d.
    We chose 20 centimeters as the break point based on the vertical profiles of root water uptake, and with a preference for not splitting any of the discrete soil layers.
    Soil Layers 1-4 span 0 to 0.2 meters, and Soil Layers 5-20 span 0.2 to 8.6 meters.
    Time series of total cumulative ambient precipitation are shown for comparison (Figs \ref{fig7}b and \ref{fig8}b).
    
        
\subsection{Hydraulic redistribution}
    Hydraulic redistribution refers to flows of water between soil layers through vegetation substrate.
    To calculate total HR, we sum the negative root water uptake fluxes ((i.e., root to soil fluxes) across all soil layers.
    Total HR, partitioned by month and by daytime versus nighttime is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hr}.
    Note that over the course of a day or season, HR can occur without net negative root water uptake.
    For example, hydraulic lift may occur at night, moving water from deep in the soil column up to near the surface, which is then more readily available for transpiration during the following day.  This can 
    result in HR occurring even when there is net positive root water uptake.
    This type of feature is evident in Figure \ref{fig7}, where there is net positive root water uptake throughout the soil column over the 2003 dry season, even when there is significant HR into the near-surface layers (Fig \ref{fig:hr}).

\subsection{Soil moisture}
    The vertical profile soil water potential under 60\% TFE is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:sm} (SMA, DO NOT SAY THIS IS PLOTTED BUT DESCIRBE RESULTS AND MENTION FIGURE).
    The range in soil potential is much larger within the SMS paradigm, which made it difficult to plot both panels with the same color scale.
    In order to preserve information in the PHS plot, we opt for a scale of 0 to -1 MPa, as compared to 0 to -3 MPa for SMS.
    When comparing column average soil potential, we use separate definitions, which reflect each paradigm's representation of soil water availability.
    With SMS, we opt for a root-fraction weighted average, following from Equation \ref{eq:btrwu}.
    This is a poor measure for PHS, because it neglects gravitational contributions and the appropriate root area basis. 
    Instead we opt for predawn (defined at 5AM) root water potential, which, given minimal transpiration at night, is in equilibrium with the soil column. 
    
\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Modeling vegetation water potential}
    
    The models are compared for the 2003 dry season (Sept-Oct-Nov or SON) at Caxiuana for two experiments: the first with ambient rainfall (AMB), and the second with 60\% of rainfall excluded, or 'through-fall exclusion' (TFE), Figure \ref{fig:vwp}. 
    
    In the ambient simulation (Fig \ref{fig:vwp}a), average midday water potentials are -1.96, -1.95, -1.94 MPa for sunlit leaf, shaded leaf, and stem, respectively. With through-fall exclusion (TFE), as expected the midday water potentials decrease to -2.77, -2.76, -2.75 MPa, respectively (Fig \ref{fig:vwp}b).
    
    Both panels show the characteristic drop in water potential around midday and the expected sequencing with the leaf water potentials more negative than the stem potential, which is more negative than the root potential. The sequencing is difficult to distinguish from the plot, where the stem, sunlit, and shaded leaf water potential curves nearly overlap for both experiments because there is only very small drop in potential between the stem and leaves. 
    
    The small difference between leaf and stem water potentials results from minimal resistance to water flow across these segments. (LINK THIS TO THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT) The current PHS parameterization of stem-to-leaf resistance is relatively simple compared to the literature \citep{franks2007} and could be advanced in future versions. 
    
    TFE lowers average midday sunlit leaf water potential by 0.81 MPa compared to the ambient simulation, during SON-2003 (dry season). This change in leaf water potential can be partitioned into the change in soil water potential, the change in potential drop from soil-to-root, and the change in potential drop from root-to-leaf. 
    
    Beginning with the change in soil water potential, in the ambient simulation, average predawn (5AM) root water potential (an integrated measure of soil water potential) is -0.075 MPa. With TFE, it falls to -0.36 MPa, resulting in a decrease in predawn root water potential of 0.28 MPa relative to the ambient simulation. The difference between midday and predawn root water potential (which stands in for potential drop from soil-to-root) is lowered by 1.06 MPa in the simulate TFE plot (from -0.06 MPa, ambient, to -1.12 MPA, TFE).
    
    The difference between sunlit leaf and stem water potential at midday acts in the opposite direction, changing from -1.83 MPa in the ambient simulation to -1.29 MPa with TFE, attenuating the drop in leaf water potential by 0.54 MPa.
    
    Predicted water potential values are comparable with field observations, where average dry season leaf water potential was measured as -2.47 MPa \citep{fisher2006}. With PHS, modeled change in leaf water potential due to TFE is -0.81MPa, which can be partitioned into -0.28 MPa predawn root water potential, -1.06 soil-to-root drop, +0.53 root-to-leaf drop. The drop in water potential across the stem partially abates the change in the soil and roots due to TFE. 
    
    Though stem conductance decreases with drying, transpiration also decreases, yielding a net effect of a smaller drop in water potential across the stem. This is consistent with findings in \cite{fisher2006} that most of the whole-plant resistance is above ground, but that added resistance from drying is predominately sourced? below ground. Likewise \cite{fisher2006} found evidence of isohydric behavior, where plants manage water loss through stomata to regulate leaf water potential, which is consistent with results here of reduction in potential drop across the stem. However, PHS shows declines in midday leaf water potential due to TFE, but \cite{fisher2006} found no significant observed difference between ambient and TFE dry season leaf water potential. This could indicate that our parameters do not result in sufficiently isohydric behavior.
    
    Many facets of our hydraulic representation are simplified relative to the literature, reflecting that in a model designed to operate at the global scale,  there is a tradeoff between added complexity and parameter reduction. The current PHS parameterization omits vegetation capacitance,  which may be important for accurately modeling the diurnal cycle of water stress especially in tropical rainforests \citep{meinzer2009}. Further, hydraulic conductance hysteresis and permanent cavitation are absent from the PHS vulnerability parameterization, whereby xylem segments fully regain conducting capacity upon re-wetting. This limits the influence of drought legacy, which has been shown to be significant for forest mortality \citep{anderegg2013}.
    
    Similar to other simplified models \citep{xu2016}, loss of conductance is based on lower terminus water potential, which may underestimate integrated loss of conductivity \citep{sperry2015}. These simplifications each serve to lessen the parameter and/or computational burden of PHS. Our objective was to simplify the plant hydraulic representation for this initial implementation, acknowledging that more comprehensive process representation may prove necessary for future model versions.

\subsection{Stress factor, annual dynamics}
    
    Figure \ref{fig:mm} shows monthly mean values of the water stress factor, gross primary productivity, and transpiration over the three-year simulations for PHS versus SMS under ambient and 60\% through-fall exclusion conditions. Under ambient through-fall conditions, the SMS simulation features less stress (Fig \ref{fig:mm}b), with no stress ($f_w$>0.99) in 24 out of 36 months.
    
    PHS predicts more stress (Fig \ref{fig:mm}a), with stress in sync with the evolution of midday leaf water potential (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}). As a result, $f_w$ is generally lowest in September (Fig \ref{fig:mm}e). ZQZ need to go back and output btran proper.
    Alternatively, SMS predicts no stress ($f_w$>0.99) during any of the three Septembers of the ambient simulation. Instead $f_w$ is generally lowest in December.
    
    SMS has the most stress in December, which is associated with lower soil moisture (Supp Fig \ref{supp:smp}). While soil moisture is lowest in December, transpiration demand is higher in September, which is the month with the most stress in the PHS simulations (Fig\ref{fig:mm}a). To achieve high transpiration rates, vegetation must operate with a large gradient in water potential from soil-to-leaf, associated with increased xylem tension and risk of cavitation. As such, leaf water potential declines with soil moisture drying, but also with increasing transpiration demand (Fig \ref{fig:vwp}). PHS is designed to represent hydraulic limitation to transpiration associated with xylem tension, which responds to both soil drying and increased transpiration demand (i.e. higher VPD) \citep{sperry2015}. The latter is absent from the SMS formulation.
    
    Through-fall exclusion (which initiates on November 1, 2001) adds stress in both the SMS and PHS simulations (Fig\ref{fig:mm}c,d) .
    The added stress is greater and the onset faster with SMS.
    In both cases, the effect of TFE accumulates in time, with less photosynthesis and transpiration in 2003 compared to 2002.
    This is not reflected in the sap flux observations, which feature a more rapid onset of reduced transpiration, and similar transpiration between 2002 and 2003.
    
    In both SMS and PHS, soil water is used to buffer shortfalls in precipitation versus transpiration (Supp Fig \ref{supp:buff}). (UNLCEAR). Transpiration in PHS is less sensitive to TFE, which can be partly attributable to differences in root water uptake (see Section \ref{sect:rwu}).  PHS utilizes more deep soil water to mitigate declines in root-zone soil moisture as water flow is imposed to go down water potential gradients. In the dry season surface drying also decreases soil-root conductance so that it is easier to extract moisture from deeper layers, consistent with observations based on isotopes (CITATION).
    
    Another dynamic feature of PHS is that hydraulic limitation establishes a negative feedback loop between photosynthesis/transpiration and water stress. If photosynthesis increases, generally stomatal conductance and transpiration increase. This causes more negative leaf water potential and an associated increase in water stress, which attenuates photosynthesis. This diminishes variability in transpiration and photosynthesis, relative to SMS (Fig \ref{fig:mm}c-f). The strength of this feedback is subject to parameters controlling maximum conductance and the stomatal response to leaf water potential. Quantifying variability in diffusive fluxes with PHS as compared to SMS and observations is an important topic for future studies (See Lawrence et al in prep).
    
    Significant uncertainty exists in soil and root hydraulic parameters as well as the root distribution, whereby better behavior may exist within the plausible parameter space. Likewise, the parameter values for both stress implementations could be tuned further. Observations indicate the trees here adopt an isohydric behavior, where declines in soil moisture are tightly coupled with reduced transpiration, which mitigates decreases in leaf water potential \citep{fisher2006}. The parameter values employed for these simulations may be insufficiently isohydric (GIVE REFERENCE AND DEFINE ISOHYDRICITY), which could explain limited sensitivity to TFE relative to observations.
    


\subsection{Stress factor, diurnal dynamics}
    
    In addition to changes in the annual cycle, PHS introduces a diurnal cycle to $f_w$ (Fig \ref{fig4}a).  The SMS version of $f_w$ exhibits almost no diurnal variability (Fig \ref{fig4}b) since  water stress is therein a function of soil water potential, which lacks a significant diurnal cycle. PHS uses a function of leaf water potential (e.g. Fig \ref{fig:vwp}a,b) to model water stress, which responds to diurnal variation in transpiration demand (via changes in VPD, solar radiation, etc.).
    
    The relationship of water stress with VPD and soil potential is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vpd}. To emphasize the relationship with VPD, data are subsetted for a small window in downwelling solar radiation (between 400 and 425 W/m2). For the TFE simulations (panels $c$ and $d$), we also subset for years 2002 and 2003, because TFE was not active during most of 2001. Points are colored based on soil potential, partitioning the data from each plot into terciles, blue points are wettest, red points driest, and yellow points intermediate. For details on the soil water classification and radiation subsetting see Section zqz (THIS SHOULD BE IN CAPTION NOT MAIN TEXT).
    
    The SMS version of $f_w$ has a clear dependence on soil potential, but no relationship with VPD (Fig \ref{fig:vpd}b,d), as expected. Drier soil potentials are associated with lower values of $f_w$ (which corresponds to more stress). With PHS, higher VPD results in more stress (Fig\ref{fig:vpd}a,c). Under ambient through-fall conditions (Fig\ref{fig:vpd}a), soil water potential has minimal influence. With TFE, stress responds to both VPD and soil water (Figure \ref{fig:vpd}c). Similar effects are shown in response to downwelling solar radiation (Supp Fig \ref{supp:fsds}).
    
    Water stress is applied to capture limitations with declining water status that are not reflected within the Medlyn stomatal optimization theory (which only optimizes $\delta E / \delta A$, and thus does not take water supply into account). CLM implements non-stomatal limitation by multiplying $V_{\text{cmax}}$ by $f_w$. Though there is limited evidence of down-regulation of $V_{\text{cmax}}$ \citep{flexas2006}, this was the best option within CLM  for applying stress through the GPP term of the stomatal conductance model, in accordance with field observations \citep{lin2018,zhou2013}.
    If in future versions of CLM, mesophyll conductance is represented, it may be a more appropriate avenue for achieving the same effect. (MERGE WITH PREVIOUS DISCUSSION, TRY AVOIDING REPETITIONS A MUCH AS POSSIBLE)
    
    Total soil water content (or departure from saturation) is a typical basis for diagnosing water status and stress \citep{drake2017}, which is in line with an SMS-type approach.
    While capturing supply limitations, this framework neglects effects of transpiration demand on xylem tension.
    Given constant stomatal conductance, xylem tension increases with declining soil water, but also with increasing vapor pressure deficit.
    While VPD sensitivity is included in the Medlyn model, it serves to mitigate increasing water costs, without consideration of cavitation.
    Evidence suggests that vegetation employ water use strategies to mitigate the risk of cavitation associated with increasing xylem tension \citep{sperry1998,fisher2006,choat2012}.
    Utilizing leaf water potential as the basis for water status reflects this constraint.
    This may be especially important given projected increases in VPD associated with warming.

\subsection{Hydraulic conductance: PHS vs SMS (implied)}

\label{sect:cond}
    
    Soil-to-root conductance ($k_{sr}$) is explicitly represented in PHS, modeled as a function of soil potential (zqz). With SMS, $k_{sr}$ is not explicitly modeled, but it can be inferred, by dividing root water uptake by the gradient in water potential (see Section zqz). Comparing conductance under these two paradigms serves to highlight differences in how water supply is modeled. In , we plot the time-series of conductance values from Soil Layer 3 (spanning from 6 to 12 centimeters below the surface) under ambient through-fall conditions during 2003, along with precipitation over the same period (PLUG IN CAPTION).
    
    During the wet season, PHS conductance is greater than SMS by more than two orders of magnitude (Fig \ref{fig:cond}a,b). PHS conductance is generally steady through the wet season (Fig \ref{fig:cond}a), followed by a slow decline over the dry season with short resurgence episodes associated with rain events. The SMS implied conductance features more variability relative to the mean (Fig \ref{fig:cond}b). During FMA-2003, average intra-day standard deviation of Layer 3 conductance is 4.6e-12 s$^{-1}$ with PHS and 9.9e-12 s$^{-1}$ with SMS. In an absolute sense the SMS standard deviation is about twice as large as PHS. The difference is larger in a relative sense, as this corresponds to 0.08\% of the mean FMA conductance with PHS and 62.9\% of the mean FMA conductance with SMS.
    
    The SMS inferred conductance is tethered to transpiration (see Section \ref{sect:btran}), 
    which leads to the high variance and a clear diurnal cycle (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cond}). 
    Instead PHS calculates $k_{sr}$ based on soil hydraulic properties and root xylem vulnerability, which better reflects the physics (flow has to be down water potential gradients) and the temporal dynamics of transpiration demand.
    
    As a result conductance is less variable, with the expected responses to drydown (loss of conductance) and re-wetting (increased conductance). This is further demonstrated in Figure 7, where we plot the daily mean conductance from Soil Layer 3. With 60\% through-fall exclusion (Fig7a, dotted line), PHS conductance decreases, whereas with SMS, the daily mean conductance increases (Fig7b). The latter SMS increase is unrealistic and conflicts with extensive literature demonstrating loss of conductivity with drying (CITATIONS).
    
    Despite two orders of magnitude difference in conductances, total root water uptake during FMA2003 is not very different (23.4 cm PHS vs. 24.9 cm SMS). The reason for these smaller differences, is that the extraction gradient compensate for the differences in conductance. The SMS extraction gradient is measured relative to $\psi_c$ (a parameter defining soil potential with stomates fully closed), which equals -2.5MPa for BET. The PHS extraction gradient is relative to root water potential which during 2003 (ambient through-fall) varies between -0.02 and -0.23 MPa. \citet{fisher2006} measured stem water potential consistently higher (less negative) than -0.5MPa.
    
    With TFE, PHS Layer 3 conductance can approach the values seen in SMS. The average Layer 3 conductance with PHS for August 2003 (60\%TFE) is 4.75e-11 s$^{-1}$ as compared to 3.89e-11 s$^{-1}$ for SMS. This is a result of the orders of magnitude response of PHS soil-to-root conductance to changes in soil potential (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cond2}) (UNCLEAR MODIFY SENTENCE).  This conforms with typical soil hydraulics, where large changes in conductance occur with drying. On the other hand, SMS conductance has no clear relationship with soil potential (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cond2}). 

\subsection{Root Water Uptake: PHS vs SMS}
\label{sect:rwu}

    Root water uptake is the flux of water ($q_i$, mm/s) extracted from each of the vertically discretized soil layers ($i=\left[1,2,...,n\right]$). These fluxes are used as the soil transpiration sink terms within the Richards' equation \citep{oleson2013} and, summed over the soil column, are equivalent to the transpiration flux. As described above (and in Section \ref{sect:btran}), PHS adopts a hydraulic framework for root water uptake. 

    PHS simulations (black color), feature more surface extraction than with SMS, especially under ambient through-fall conditions (Fig\ref{fig7}a), during the 2003 dry season. The time-series of PHS total cumulative extraction (cm) from near-surface soil (Fig\ref{fig7}b) responds to precipitation (Fig\ref{fig7}d), with increased surface extraction after rain events.
    
    Under ambient conditions the SMS partitioning of extraction between near-surface and depth is not sensitive to precipitation. In PHS near-surface extraction decreases by 40\% with TFE (8.12 vs 13.51 cm), while, SMS features a 24\% increase in absolute terms (5.28 vs 6.55 cm, Fig \ref{fig7}b). Under TFE, both PHS and SMS extract minimal water from between 0.5 and 4m, (3.18 cm and 0.56 cm, respectively, over the three months). Both compensate by increasing extraction from below 4m, but PHS to a much larger extent, which corresponds to overall significantly more root water uptake during TFE.
    
    Root water uptake dynamics respond to changes in hydraulic conductance and/or changes in the gradient in water potential. PHS has more access to water at depth under TFE, associated with higher conductance values. With decreasing soil potential, hydraulic conductance decreases with PHS, but can increase with SMS (\ref{sect:cond}). Instead SMS is limited by the extraction gradient, with root water uptake declining to zero as soil potential approaches -2.5 MPa (Supp Fig \ref{supp:rwu}). PHS is more sensitive to changes in soil water potential, with stronger decreases in root water uptake in response to drying within a soil layer (Supp Fig \ref{supp:rwu}). In response, PHS features increases in near-surface water uptake after rain and decreases with TFE.

    The wet season (Feb-Mar-Apr FMA-2003), features more and steadier rain (Fig \ref{fig8}d). PHS responds with an increase in the proportion of water extraction from near the surface relative to SON. Under ambient conditions net extraction is zero beyond about 38 centimeters depth (Fig \ref{fig8}a, solid black line). In comparison, SMS extracts more than half its water from beyond 1 meter in depth even during the wet season (Fig \ref{fig8}a, solid gray line). With TFE, PHS extraction is negative beyond 20 centimeters, indicating hydraulic redistribution (Fig \ref{fig8}c). Over the three month FMA-2003 period, there is no net root water uptake below 20 centimeters depth, but rather a deposition of about 10 cm of water is simulated.
    
    In both the wet and dry season, PHS features significantly more root water uptake from the near-surface layers (0 to 20cm in depth). Modeled surface extraction is especially high over the wet season under through-fall exclusion conditions, summing to 32.7 cm over 89 days. By comparison SMS extracts 4.8 cm under the same conditions. With a soil porosity of 0.42, the top 20 cm of soil hold only 8.2cm of water at saturation.
    
    Conductances are higher with PHS (see Section \ref{sect:cond}), which allows for higher rates of root water uptake, especially from moist soil layers. Likewise PHS better reflects penalties for extraction from depth (Section \ref{sect:btran}, favoring near-surface water all else being equal. The highest rates of root water uptake (relative to layer size) occur from Soil Layer 2, after rain events during the dry season (Supp Fig A.7). Lowering maximum conductance can attenuate high rates of extraction, if observations conflict with model output.

    The PHS configuration allows for more realistic root water uptake, incorporating hydraulic theory. SMS does not accurately represent xylem loss of conductance or the dynamics of vegetation water potential. Both are difficult to parameterize, given the scarcity of data describing states, traits, and fluxes underground. PHS offers a process connection between soil potential and leaf water potential, which may be used to evaluate the model.

\subsection{Hydraulic redistribution}

    During the wet season surface extraction supplies transpiration, but is also redistributed into lower soil layers. Hydraulic redistribution has been observed in the field \citep{oliveira2005}, and is not represented in the SMS version of the CLM \citep{lee2005}. which sets root water uptake to zero if the gradient in water potential is negative. 
    
    
    For HR to occur into a soil layer, the soil potential must be more negative (drier) than the $\psi_{\text{root}}$ (see Figure . During the day, transpiration requires a gradient in water potential from soil-to-root, which lowers $\psi_{\text{root}}$, decreasing the amount of HR.Therefore, in PHS, more HR occurs at night, in accordance with observations and theory \citep{oliveira2005,lee2005}.
    
    HR is predominately downwards during the wet season (FMA), serving to diminish the gradient between the newly-wetted surface and still-dry depths (Supp Figs A.6,A.7). Redistribution occurs in both directions during the dry season (SON), downwards after rain events, and upwards with drying. Only with TFE, and only during the dry season, is there significant extraction beyond 6 meters (Figs 8, 9). There is very little water deposited at depths beyond 6 meters at any point in either simulation.
    
    Under ambient conditions simulated HR in PHS totals to 41.3 cm (10.3 cm during the day, 31.0 cm at night), Figure \ref{fig:hr}. HR declines slightly to 37.0 cm (11.5 cm day and 25.5 cm night) with TFE. For reference, total transpiration over the same time period was 120 and 99 cm for ambient and TFE conditions, respectively. The TFE simulation has less HR overall, but more HR during wet months, Feb-June.
    
    Increased downwards? HR within the TFE plot occurs in Feb-June, associated with the drier TFE soils and larger gradients in soil potential from surface to depth. HR is lower in January, and July-December with TFE. Similar to during the wet months the gradient in soil potential (in this case from depth to surface) is larger with TFE. However, the soils overall are so dry with TFE during the dry months, that loss of conductance from soil-to-root counteracts the large gradient, resulting in lower HR.
    
    The dynamics of HR with PHS align with observations, with more HR at night, and HR occurring in both directions vertically \citep{burgess1998}.
    The absolute values of HR are difficult to assess, given limited observations.
    
    In PHS, Allowing HR to occur into the top layer of the soil column significantly degraded modeled soil evaporation (not shown). We opted to omit the first top Layer (spanning 0 to 2 cm below ground) soil-to-root hydraulic conductance, to prevent HR from over-supplying water for soil evaporation.
    
\subsubsection{Is hydraulic redistribution a feature or a liability?}
   
    HR is a natural consequence of using Darcy's Law to model root water uptake - when hydraulic gradients are reversed, HR should occur. As such it is naturally included within a plant hydraulics model with multiple soil layers and is an emergent behavior of respecting hydraulic flow down gradient of potentials.  In ESMs, where soil moisture is typically resolved vertically, interfacing the plant hydrulics with a multi-layer soil naturally accounts for HR. Other models, similar to the SMS paradigm, disallow HR by constraining root water uptake to be positive \citep{xu2016}.
    
    Most literature models force the model with a single bulk soil water potential $\psi_s$, which precludes HR \citep{fisher2007,bonan2014,sperry2017}. \cite{christoffersen2016} expand beyond a single $\psi_s$ horizontally, representing soil elements at different charecteristic distances from the root surface,  but still feature a single soil layer in the vertical dimension.  
    
    Likewise HR is likely sensitive to the representation of vegetation tissue capacitance and below-ground hydraulic segmentation (CITAIONS NEEDED).
    
    Hydraulic redistribution has the impact of reducing the variance in the availability of water for plant transpiration, potentially at odds with observations of interannual variation (see Lawrence et al in prep. Tang et al. 2015) Observations of HR are extremely difficult, in unequivocal detection of HR involves the observation of reverse flow along transport roots, typically at rates close ot the detection threshold of sap flow monitoring systems. Therefore, the degree to which HR actually occurs in unclear. While there is some first-order benefit to plants of moving water from deep soil to surface layers to allow more transpiration, this water is then also available for competition with other shallow-rooted plants, and for evaporative processes. Further, cavitation of fine roots in shallow soils might explicitly act as a 'fuse' to prevent loss of water from the plant into dry soil layers (Kotowska et al. 2015) - a process not explicitly resolved here. Therefore we view this first implementation of HR into the default versions of the CLM as a 'null' hypothesis for the functioning of this process, and as a platform to allow further refinement from the plant hydraulics community. 
    

\subsection{Soil moisture profile}

    The column total soil water in all four simulations is initialized at 2.66 meters (over an 8.6-meter soil column) (SAY WHY). The change in total soil water is small under ambient conditions, decreasing by 0.3cm with PHS and 9.6cm with SMS over the three-year simulations. Root zone soil potential is lower with SMS, with a root-fraction-weighted average soil potential of -0.42 MPa during November 2003. The equivalent metric from PHS, average predawn root water potential, is -0.08 MPa. 
    
    Under 60\% through-fall exclusion, the change in soil water is -1.12 meters with PHS and -0.94 meters with SMS, relative to the ambient simulations (Supp Fig \ref{supp:buff}). 
    
    With SMS, root-fraction-weighted average soil potential is -2.18MPa during November 2003, whereas  PHS average predawn root water potential is -0.37MPa (Figure \ref{fig:sm}). Observations of root-zone potential based on gravity-corrected predawn leaf water potential are -0.17 +/- 0.10 MPa under ambient conditions, and -0.71 +/- 0.31 MPa with through-fall exclusion (also in November 2003) \citep{fisher2007}.  The SMS root-weighted water potential is 1.81 MPa drier (from a soil water potential perspective) because the SMS continues to extract water from dry layers with high fractions of roots, further drying these layers and decreasing the root-weighted water potential (see Section \ref{sect:cond}).  Further, PHS has more access to deep soil water under dry conditions (Fig \ref{fig7}), which mitigates declines in soil potential near the surface.
    
    While PHS better matches observations of root-zone soil potential, we hesitate to make conclusions about model skill due to parameter uncertainty and due to the fact that these values may be sensitive to tuning (see Section \ref{sect:param}), as well as the fact that both models feature high biases in transpiration relative to observations.
    
    Darcy's Law establishes that water flow is proportional to the gradient in total water potential. 
    With PHS, this gradient is measured relative to dynamic $\psi_{\text{root}}$.
    With SMS, this gradient is measured relative to a constant parameter, $\psi_c$, the soil water potential at which stomates fully close.
    This approach is required without prognostic vegetation water potential, but yields unsatisfactory dynamics that do not comply with the physics of porous media flow (see Section \ref{sect:cond}).
    Furthermore, it seems that $\psi_c$ has historically been tuned for its effects on diffusive fluxes, without specific attention to the effect on soil moisture dynamics 
    (Can someone else back me up on this? Is there a way to cite this?).
    
    This is problematic because soil moisture dynamics are very sensitive to $\psi_c$.    Root water uptake halts when soil potential reaches $\psi_c$ (Section \ref{sect:btran}), setting an effective minimum soil potential, a situation that is apparent in Figure \ref{fig:sm} where soil water potential for SMS  stays at approximately -2.5 MPa, which is the value of $\psi_c$ for evergreen tropical broadleaf trees (?.    This feature is clearer in Figure \ref{supp:sm2}, where soil layers can be seen to dry out quickly, but not beyond -2.5 MPa     (with the exception of Soil Layers 1 and 2, which are influenced by bare soil evaporation).    The effect of $\psi_c$ extends to ambient through-fall conditions (Fig \ref{supp:sm}), but over a smaller spatial and temporal domain.    PHS has more flexibility, due to dynamic root water potential, so there is not the same tendency to dry out quickly to a specific level.    Instead minimum soil water potential for PHS gets lower each dry season throughout the TFE simulation (Fig \ref{fig:sm}a).
    
    [Add some material looking at the vertical profile of soil moisture in the models vs observations?] 
    
    
    Soil water dynamics in CLM are sensitive to the representation of root water uptake, but due to the scarcity of observational constraints, vertically-resolved soil moisture predictions are challenging to evaluate.
    
    
    
    
    With PHS, because we're modeling vegetation water potential, we can utilize a hydraulic framework, 
    which offers a well-established physical basis and a clear improvement in model structure.
    SMS root water uptake has problematic model structure, seemingly no empirical basis, and intuitively does not look good on soil water dynamics.
    PHS improves model structure, but it also adds parameters that are difficult to constrain. 

    PHS offers leaf and stem water potential observations, which are downstream of soil potential, and could be an exciting opportunity to interface with observations. 
    While PHS seems a clear improvement over SMS, which does not comport well with fundamental aspects of hydraulic theory, further work on the representation of root water uptake in models is needed to validate both soil water states and fluxes.
    


\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Caveats}

    Modeling stomatal conductance and photosynthesis, especially subject to water stress, is an area of ongoing research. We use the Medlyn model coupled to a hydraulic stress function that attenuates $V_{\text{cmax}}$. This complies with observations \citep{lin2018,zhou2013} that stress applied through $g_1$ underestimates attenuation of photosynthesis. However, there is no direct evidence of declines in $V_{\text{cmax}}$ with drought \citep{flexas2006}, whereby future work may seek to represent mesophyll conductance in CLM.
    
    The model hydraulic supply representation is simplified, to reduce the model parameter and computational burdens.
    No capacitance.
    No integration of xylem or soil conductances vulnerability, instead based on lower node.
    No hysteresis in loss of conductance, xylem instantly regain conductance upon re-wetting.
    Leaf conductance simplified.
    Soil layers fully parallel, soil potential constant each time step.
    
    Parameter uncertainty is significant.
    Notions of hydraulic architecture will never perfectly fit on this modeling scale, especially in a PFT paradigm.
    Field measurements of hydraulic traits will help constrain parameter ranges, but mostly only aboveground.
    Flux observations can help to tune stress parameters.
    Parameter estimation for root functioning is significantly more challenging, given the difficulty in underground trait observations.
    Likewise observational constraints of vertically-resolved states and fluxes underground are scarce.
    Follow-up work will be geared towards parameter estimation and assessing model skill.

\subsection{Utility of modeling vegetation water potential}


    The PHS configuration of the CLM5 is, to our knowledge, the first Earth System Model with a representation of plant water potential running in its default configuration. In this paper, we have described the model implementation, and illustrated a comparison of the model dynamics for a tropical rainforest site subjected to water limitation, given that prediction of rainforest responses to drought is one of the key uncertainties in the ESM predictions. Overall, the new model behaviour differs from the default configuration in ways that are expected, given its structural properties, and in many cases, provides better correspondance with the observations that the default structure. 
    
    In this paper, however, we do not undertake a comprehensive assessment of which model structure performs better, given the substantial parametric uncertainty in both models, and the dependence on numerous other features of the CLM external to water stress representation that contribute to model-observation divergences - in this case in particular, the overestimation of unstressed transpiration by both versions of the model compared to the observations. 
    
    In lieu of this type of assessment, we propose that the new PHS model structure 1) is more closely aligned with known plant hydraulics theory, 2) provides significantly improved connections to real-world observational data streams (of leaf and stem water status, sap flow, percent loss conductance) and 3) represents known features of ecohydrological function that the default model cannot capture, including hydraulic redistribution, changes in the depth of water uptake with drought stress, plant embolism impacts on gas exchange and responses of water uptake to changes in leaf:root rations. 
    
   
    This will be the final conclusions.
    Any comments on overall takeaways?

    PHS models vegetation water potential. 
    This offers structural improvements for stress and for root water uptake.
    Stress now functions with hydraulic limitation.

\subsection{Details of Water Supply}

PHS resolves flow across four different segments, soil-to-root, root-to-stem, stem-to-leaf, and leaf-to-transpiration.

Stem-to-leaf. The area bases are sunlit and shaded leaf area, respectively. 
Note that gravity is assumed negligible here. 
Likewise there is no length scaling applied to maximum conductance. 
Therefore the input parameters for $k_{1,\text{max}}$ should be conductances ($s^{-1}$).

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
q_{1a} &= k_{1} \cdot \text{LAI-sun}  \cdot \left( \psi_{\text{stem}}-\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}\right) \\
q_{1b} &= k_{1} \cdot \text{LAI-shade} \cdot  \left( \psi_{\text{stem}}-\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}\right)
\end{aligned} \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{1} = k_{1,\text{max}} \cdot f\left(\psi_{\text{stem}}\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
f\left(\psi\right)=2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi}{p_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
\end{aligned} \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Root-to-stem. The area basis is stem area index. 
The parameter is maximum stem xylem conductivity ($K_{2,\text{max}}$).
Stem conductance ($k_2$) is the result of scaling maximum conductivity by the tree height ($h$)
and applying loss relative to maximum conductance via the vulnerability curve $f\left(\psi_{\text{root}}\right)$. 
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
q_2 = k_2 \cdot  \text{SAI}  \cdot \left( \psi_{\text{root}}-\psi_{\text{stem}}-\rho g h\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_2 = \dfrac{K_{2,\text{max}}}{h} \cdot f\left(\psi_{\text{root}}\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Soil-to-root. Area basis is RAI in soil layer $i$, which is based on the layer root fraction times the
total root area. Total root area we have as the summed stem and leaf area indices multiplied by a relative
root area parameter ($f_{\text{root}}$).
The vertical root distribution is defined by the layer root fraction ($r_i$), which follows a one-parameter 
(by PFT) power law decay following \citet{jackson1996}.

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
q_{3,i} = k_{3,i} \cdot  \text{RAI}_i  \cdot \left( \psi_{\text{soil,i}}-\psi_{\text{root}}-\rho g z_i\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
\text{RAI}_i=f_{\text{root}} \cdot \left( \text{SAI} + \text{LAI} \right) \cdot r_i
\label{eq:rai}
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{3,i} = \dfrac{k_{r,i}+k_{s,i}}{k_{r,i}\cdot k_{s,i}}
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{r,i} = \dfrac{K_{r,\text{max}}}{l_i} f \left(\psi_{\text{soil,i}}\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
l_i = z_i + x
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{s,i} = \dfrac{K_{s,i}}{d}
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

The conductance $k_{3,i}$ reflects two resistors in series, from soil-to-root ($k_{s,i}$) and through the
root tissue ($k_{r,i}$).
The root tissue conductance is attenuated via the vulnerability curve framework. 
The input parameter is maximum root xylem conductivity, on the basis of RAI as defined above.
The root conductivity is scaled by the conducting length, which is estimated as the sum of soil layer depth ($z_i$)
and average lateral extent ($x$, static parameter).
The soil conductivity $K_{s,i}$ is calculated from the layer soil matric potential ($\psi_s$) 
and soil properties following \citet{clapp1978} as described in \citet{oleson2013}.
The soil conductance ($k_{s,i}$) is the result of scaling the conductivity by $d$, 
 the distance between roots estimated following \citet{williams1996} and \citet{bonan2014}

The challenge here is obviously getting your head around all the parameters.

\subsection{Details of Solution}


The continuity of water flow through the system yields four equations
   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   E_{sun}&=q_{1a}\\
   E_{shade}&=q_{1b}\\
   q_{1a}+q_{1b}&=q_2\\
   q_2&=\sum_{i=1}^{nlevsoi}{q_{3,i}}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

We seek the set of vegetation water potential values (four unknowns), 

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \psi=\left[ \begin {array}{c} 
   \psi_{sunleaf}\cr\psi_{shadeleaf}\cr\psi_{stem}\cr\psi_{root}
   \end {array} \right] 
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

that satisfies these equations, as forced by the soil moisture and atmospheric state. 

Each flux on the schematic can be represented in terms of the relevant water potentials. 

Defining the transpiration fluxes:


   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   E_{sun} &= E_{sun,max} \cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{sunleaf}}{p50_e}\right)^{c_k}} \\
   E_{shade} &= E_{shade,max} \cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{shadeleaf}}{p50_e}\right)^{c_k}} 
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Defining the water supply fluxes:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   q_{1a}&=k_{1a,max}\cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{stem}}{p50_1}\right)^{c_k}} \cdot\mbox{LAI}_{sun}\cdot\left(\psi_{stem}-\psi_{sunleaf} \right) \\
   q_{1b}&=k_{1b,max}\cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{stem}}{p50_1}\right)^{c_k}}\cdot\mbox{LAI}_{shade}\cdot\left(\psi_{stem}-\psi_{shadeleaf} \right) \\
   q_2&=\dfrac{k_{2,max}}{z_2} \cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{root}}{p50_2}\right)^{c_k}} \cdot SAI \cdot \left( \psi_{root} - \psi_{stem} - \Delta \psi_z  \right) \\
   q_{soil}&=\sum_{i=1}^{nlevsoi}{q_{3,i}}=\sum_{i=1}^{nlevsoi}{k_{3,i}\cdot RAI\cdot\left(\psi_{soil,i}-\psi_{root} + \Delta\psi_{z,i} \right)}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

We're looking to find the vector $\psi$
that fits with soil and atmospheric forcings while satisfying water flow continuity. 
Due to the model non-linearity, we use a linearized explicit approach, iterating with Newton's method. 
The initial guess is the solution for $\psi$ (vector) from the previous time step. 
The general framework, from iteration $m$ to $m+1$ is:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \begin{aligned}
   q^{m+1}&=q^m+\dfrac{\delta q}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi \\
   \psi^{m+1}&=\psi^{m}+\Delta\psi
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

So for our first flux balance equation, at iteration $m+1$, we have:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   E_{sun}^{m+1}=q_{1a}^{m+1}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Which can be linearized to:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   E_{sun}^{m}+\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi=q_{1a}^{m}+\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

And rearranged to be:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi=E_{sun}^{m}-q_{1a}^{m}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

And for the other 3 flux balance equations:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \begin{aligned}
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta E_{sha}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi&=E_{sha}^{m}-q_{1b}^{m} \\
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi&=q_{1a}^{m}+q_{1b}^{m}-q_2^{m} \\
   \dfrac{\delta q_{soil}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi&=q_2^{m}-q_{soil}^{m}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Putting all four together in matrix form:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \left[ \begin {array}{c}
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi} \cr
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sha}}{\delta\psi} \cr
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi} \cr
   \dfrac{\delta q_{soil}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}
   \end {array} \right]
   \Delta\psi=
   \left[ \begin {array}{c}
   E_{sun}^{m}-q_{1a}^{m} \cr
   E_{sha}^{m}-q_{1b}^{m} \cr
   q_{1a}^{m}+q_{1b}^{m}-q_2^{m} \cr
   q_2^{m}-q_{soil}^{m}
   \end {array} \right]
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Now to expand the left-hand side, from vector $\psi$ to the four distinct plant water potential nodes, noting that many derivatives are zero (e.g. $\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi_{sha}}=0$)

Introducing the notation:
$A\Delta\psi=b$

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \Delta\psi=\left[ \begin {array}{c}
   \Delta\psi_{sunleaf} \cr
   \Delta\psi_{shadeleaf} \cr
   \Delta\psi_{stem} \cr
   \Delta\psi_{root}
   \end {array} \right] 
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   A=
   \left[ \begin {array}{cccc}
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{sun}}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta \psi_{sun}}&0&\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&0\cr
   0&\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{sha}}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sha}}{\delta \psi_{sha}}&\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&0\cr
   -\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{sun}}&
   -\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{sha}}&
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{stem}}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{root}}\cr
   0&0&-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&\dfrac{\delta q_{soil}}{\delta \psi_{root}}-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{root}}
   \end {array} \right]
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   b=
   \left[ \begin {array}{c}
   E_{sun}^{m}-q_{b1}^{m} \cr
   E_{sha}^{m}-q_{b2}^{m} \cr
   q_{b1}^{m}+q_{b2}^{m}-q_{stem}^{m} \cr
   q_{stem}^{m}-q_{soil}^{m}
   \end {array} \right]
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Now we compute all the entries for $A$ and $b$ based on the soil moisture and maximum transpiration forcings and can solve to find:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \Delta\psi=A^{-1}b
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \psi_{m+1}=\psi_m+\Delta\psi
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

We iterate until $b\to 0$, signifying water flux balance through the system. The result is a final set of water potentials ( $\psi_{root}$, $\psi_{xylem}$, $\psi_{shadeleaf}$, $\psi_{sunleaf}$) satisfying non-divergent water flux through the system. 
The magnitude of the water flux is driven by soil matric potential and unstressed ( $\beta_t=1$) transpiration. 

We use the transpiration solution (corresponding to the final solution for $\psi$) to compute stomatal conductance. The stomatal conductance is then used to compute $\beta_t$. 

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \beta_{t,sun} = \dfrac{g_{s,sun}}{g_{s,sun,\beta_t=1}} 
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \beta_{t,shade} = \dfrac{g_{s,shade}}{g_{s,shade,\beta_t=1}} 
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

The $\beta_t$ values are used in the Photosynthesis module (see section \ref{sect:A}) to apply water stress. 
The solution for $\psi$ is saved as a new variable (vegetation water potential) and is indicative of plant water status.
The soil-to-root fluxes $\left( q_{3,1},q_{3,2},\text{...},q_{3,n}\right)$ are used as the soil transpiration sink in the Richards' equation subsurface flow equations.

    Furthermore several simplifications were made that decrease the numerical complexity.
    For the purposes of the PHS solution, soil potentials are assumed constant during each timestep.
    Plant tissue water storage (capacitance) is not represented, whereby the solution does not
    depend on the previous timestep and has no time derivatives.
