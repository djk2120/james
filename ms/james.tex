\section{Introduction}

Trees face emerging climate change risk globally \citep{allen2010,anderegg2013b}.
In addition to stress from soil moisture drought, vegetation is susceptible to increasing atmospheric demand \citep{restaino2016,novick2016b,lemordant2018}.
Increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are occurring with global warming \citep{ficklin2017,seager2015}, and are associated with impacts on vegetation such as large-scale die-off \citep{williams2013,mcdowell2015}.
Understanding vegetation response is an important priority, both for discerning climate impacts and for modeling feedbacks to the carbon and hydrological cycles \citep{lemordant2018}.
Significant uncertainty remains regarding how vegetation will respond to changes in hydroclimate within Earth System Models, feeding back onto the carbon cycle as vegetation mediates carbon uptake \citep{dekauwe2017,friedlingstein2014,trugman2018}.

Plant water stress parameterizations are important in Earth System Models, as they define vegetation regulation of surface fluxes (photosynthesis, transpiration) in response to water fluctuations \citep{egea2011,verhoef2014}.
Vegetation water use strategies modulate carbon uptake, creating a critical coupling between the Earth System's carbon and hydrological cycles \citep{green2017}.
Drought stress parameterizations (functions which relate a metric of soil moisture status to leaf gas exchange) are widely used to define the response of stomatal conductance to vegetation water status, serving to attenuate transpiration, photosynthesis, and root water uptake with drying.
The dynamics of this water stress representation in models have broad effects on critical land surface processes \citep{joetzjer2014}, such as photosynthesis rates.
On daily and weekly time scales, water stress parameterizations influence the partitioning of latent versus sensible heat, modifying the Bowen ratio \citep{gentine2007,gentine2011}. 
This in turn feeds back onto surface and air temperature, through land-atmosphere feedbacks \citep{bonan2008,seneviratne2006}.
On longer timescales vegetation water use strategies regulate the global carbon and water cycles \citep{dekauwe2015}.

Several recent studies have aimed at advancing the representation of water flow through the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum (SPAC) in land-surface and ecosystem models \citep{xu2016,christoffersen2016,sperry2017}.
Explicit modeling of water flow through the SPAC adds complexity, but is consistent with evidence of dynamic regulation of vegetation water use in response to both soil and atmospheric drying \citep{tardieu1998,sperry1998,sperry2015}.
Furthermore, because they are based on Darcy's Law, SPAC models have a robust physical basis compared to empirical water stress formulations.
SPAC models involve new parameters, which presents challenges \citep{drake2017}, but plant hydraulic trait data are available \citep{kattge2011,anderegg2015a}, providing constraints on parameter estimation.   
Such data have been shown to be informative of species vulnerability to drought \citep{choat2012}.
Likewise vegetation water status observations are now available from remote sensing platforms, at a scale that is directly comparable to model development \citep{konings2016,grant2016} and therefore can be used to validate model results \citep{momen2017,konings2017b}.

In this study, we develop a new plant water stress parameterization based on hydraulic theory within the recently released Community Land Model, version 5 (CLM5, the land component of the Community Earth System Model version 2). 
We refer to this hydraulics-based implementation as the `Plant Hydraulic Stress' (PHS) configuration. 
Previous versions of the CLM, similar to many Land Surface Models, employed an empirical $\beta$-form soil moisture stress function.
Such functions lack a strong physical basis and have been shown to systematically overestimate the effect of soil moisture drought on evaporative fluxes \citep{ukkola2016,bonan2014}.
In Amazonia, which is the focus area of our model test runs, studies suggest that the CLM (version 3.5) simultaneously underestimates the effect of experimental drought treatment \citep{powell2013} and overestimates dry-season reductions in GPP \citep{restrepo2017}.

PHS, by explicitly representing the SPAC, introduces modeled vegetation water potential (discretized into leaf, stem and root elements) into the CLM, as well as a physical model of water supply, from the soil through the vegetation substrate. 
Transpiration is attenuated in the model according to leaf water status, capturing dynamic vegetation water use regulation in response to both soil moisture and atmospheric evaporative demand. 
These changes in the parameterization framework have numerous implications, including: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Leaf water potential serves as a metric for plant water status instead of soil water or soil matric potential. As such, it reflects vegetation sensitivity to both soil and atmospheric drying, while serving as a diagnostic for excessive xylem tension and cavitation risk. 
\item Modeling plant hydrodynamics allows representation of hydraulic redistribution \citep{lee2005}, as the flow respects Darcy's law and thus is always directed down gradients of water potentials. 
\item Root water potential can be used to predict gradient-based root water uptake based on Darcy's law, replacing the previous empirical transpiration partitioning heuristic. This provides the means to vary, for example, the mean depth of extraction with changing soil water conditions.
\item Representation of a range of water use strategies (i.e. isohydricity and anisohydricity), improving the connection between plant carbon allocation and water availability.
\item Modeling vegetation water potential allows improved connection to remote sensing observations of vegetation water status (Vegetation Optical Depth) \citep{konings2016}. 
\end{enumerate}

To assess the new model formulation, we carried out site-level simulations at Caxiuan\~a National Forest in Brazil, which features a critical biome (terra-firme moist tropical evergreen forest) \citep{fisher2006}. Starting in 2001, a plot at this site was subjected to an approximately 50\% percent precipitation throughfall exclusion. Due to the large drop in soil moisture at the precipitation exclusion site, significant vegetation water stress regulation of transpiration and photosynthesis was observed at the site, providing an interesting test for the model \citep{fisher2007}.

In this paper we therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce the PHS theory and implementation in the CLM (Section 2)
\item Describe the details of the experiment setup
\item Analyze the dynamics of modeled water stress, root water uptake and soil moisture profiles (Section 4)
\item Compare PHS to the behavior of the previous CLM water stress configuration (Section 5)
\item Discuss the benefits and limitations of the new model (Section 5.7)
\end{enumerate}

%  MODEL DESCRIPTION

\section{Model Description}
This study uses CLM5 to compare two parameterizations of water stress (Sections \ref{sect:fwsms} and \ref{sect:fwphs}) and root water uptake (Sections \ref{sect:smsrwu} and \ref{sect:phsrwu}). The first parameterization, which we refer to as Soil Moisture Stress (SMS), deploys the CLM4.5 default root water uptake and water stress implementations within CLM5. The second is called Plant Hydraulic Stress (PHS); PHS is the default configuration of CLM5. In Sections \ref{sect:gs}-\ref{sect:wsf}, we describe components that the two configurations share in common. In Sections \ref{sect:sms} and \ref{sect:phs}, we describe their differences.
    
    
%Photosynthesis
\subsection{Stomatal Conductance}
\label{sect:gs}
    CLM5 implements the Medlyn stomatal conductance model, which reconciles the empirical and optimal approaches to 
    stomatal conductance \citep{medlyn2011}.
    Such "optimal" stomatal model aims at maximizing photosynthesis relative to transpiration costs. 
    Stomatal conductance of CO$_2$ ($g_s$) is directly related to net photosynthesis ($A_n$) 
    and inversely related to the square root of the vapor pressure deficit near the leaf surface ($\sqrt{D}$) and the concentration of CO$_2$ at the leaf surface ($C_a$).
    \begin{equation}
    g_s=g_0+\left(1+\dfrac{g_1}{\sqrt{D}}\right)\dfrac{A}{C_a}
    \end{equation}
    The model features two parameters $g_0$ ($\mu$mol / m$^2$ / s) and $g_1$ (kPa$^{0.5}$). 
    The $g_0$ parameter is the minimum stomatal conductance, representing cuticular and epidermal losses (small). 
    The $g_1$ parameter relates to the marginal water cost guiding the optimization of carbon assimilation. 
    These parameters are plant functional type dependent.
    
    While maximizing assimilation relative to water transpiration costs ($A-\lambda E$), the Medlyn model does not 
    resolve concurrent limitations to stomatal conductance associated with declining soil water. 
    To represent soil water stress, and its impact on leaf-gas exchange, land surface models typically include a `water stress factor'. 

\subsection{Photosynthesis}
\label{sect:A}
    The CLM5 photosynthesis model is described in detail in \citet{bonan2011}, \citet{thornton2007},
    and \citet{oleson2013}. Photosynthesis is limited by three factors: carboxylation-limitations, light-limitations, and export-limitations 
    following \citet{farquhar1980} and \citet{harley1992}. Water stress (as discussed in the next section) is applied within the carboxylation-limited regime, by attenuating the maximum rate of carboxylation ($V_{\text{cmax}}$). The implementation extends \citet{sellers1996a,sellers1996b} with 
    co-limitation following \citet{collatz1991}. 
    
    The CLM5 photosynthesis module, in its default configuration, is a two-big-leaf model, with a sunlit and shaded leaf for each plant functional type \citep{thornton2007, dai2004, oleson2013}. 
    The canopy fluxes module iterates the solution for leaf temperatures to satisfy the leaf surface energy balances on both sunlit and shaded leaves, in response to forcing conditions.
    Within this, the photosynthesis module further iterates to solve for stomatal conductance and intercellular CO$_2$ concentration, balancing stomatal flux of CO$_2$ with photosynthetic assimilation flux of CO$_2$ (see Supp Fig B.1 for a flow chart of these iterations).


\subsection{Water stress factor}
\label{sect:wsf}
     Uncertainty remains within the literature as to how and where to apply water stress factors to photosynthesis and/or stomatal conductance 
    \citep{zhou2013,novick2016a,sperry2015}.
    In the CLM, the water stress factor ($f_w$) multiplies the 'well-watered rate' of maximum carboxylation ($V_{\text{cmax,ww}}$) to effect water stress (as described in \citet{oleson2013}). 
    
    \begin{equation}
    V_{\text{cmax}} = f_w\, V_{\text{cmax,ww}} 
    \end{equation}

    Attenuating $V_{\text{cmax}}$ is not the only method for incorporating a response to declining water availability. 
    Other models opt to apply water stress directly to stomatal conductance, linking the stomatal conductance model slope parameter to soil moisture 
    (e.g. \cite{dekauwe2015}).
     However, \cite{lin2018} found that only the intercept parameter and photosynthesis (through changes in light-use efficiency) were sensitive to soil moisture based on eddy-covariance observations and not the slope parameter.
    Furthermore \cite{zhou2013} suggest that changes in assimilation tend to exceed those predicted by modulating $g_1$ with soil moisture, but could be captured by changing $V_{\text{cmax}}$. These results would thus suggest that it is appropriate to modulate $V_{\text{cmax}}$.
    Other field studies, however, suggest that measured $V_{\text{cmax}}$ at the leaf level does not change with drought \citep{flexas2004}. 
    On the other hand, the modeled $V_{\text{cmax}}$ is a bulk measure of $V_{\text{cmax}}$ and may implicitly account for mesophyll conductance changes \citep{rogers2017}, which has been shown to be water stress dependent \citep{flexas2012}.

    For now, applying water stress through $V_{\text{cmax}}$ seems well-supported, but future refinements may be appropriate.
    In this study, we preserve the method of applying water stress used in CLM4.5, while experimenting with how $f_w$ responds to environmental conditions.
    
    \subsection{SMS (CLM4.5 default)}
    \label{sect:sms}
    \subsubsection{SMS Water Stress Factor}
    \label{sect:fwsms}
    
    In SMS, the water stress $f_w$ is calculated as the summation of a soil wilting factor ($w_i$) across the $n$ soil layers, weighted by root fraction ($r_i$) \citep{oleson2013}.
    The soil wilting factor is a bounded linear function of soil matric potential ($\psi_{\text{soil},i}$).
    The function is defined by two parameters, the soil potential at which stomates fully open ($\psi_o$) and the value at which stomates are fully closed ($\psi_c$).  

    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
     f_{w,\text{SMS}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{r_iw_i}
    \label{bt:1}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} 
    \label{bt:2}
    w_i=0 \leq \dfrac{\psi_{\text{soil},i}-\psi_{c}}{\psi_{o}-\psi_{c}} \leq 1
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
\subsubsection{SMS Root Water Uptake}
\label{sect:smsrwu}
    The CLM features a vertically discretized soil column with variable soil layer thicknesses.
    The number of soil layers ($n$) can vary, depending on the depth to bedrock.
    Soil water movement in each soil layer is governed by Richards' equation, with root water uptake ($q_i$) incorporated as a sink term.
    Summed over the soil column, root water uptake is required to equal transpiration ($T$).

    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    T = \sum^n_i{q_i}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*} 
    
    In the SMS configuration, a heuristic function is used to determine $q_i$.
    Transpiration is partitioned among the soil layers based on the product of the root fraction and the wilting factor, which is then normalized by $f_w$ so that 100% of the total is partitioned across the different root layers. 
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{bt:4}
    q_i = \dfrac{r_i w_i}{f_w}T
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    Substituting for $w_i$ yields the SMS root water uptake equation as a function of the layer-$i$ soil potential ($\psi_{\text{soil},i}$).
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    q_i =
    \begin{cases}
    \label{eq:btrwu}
    0    & \text{if } \psi_{\text{soil},i}<\psi_{c}  \\
    \\[1pt]
        \dfrac{T}{f_w} \dfrac{r_i}{\psi_{o}-\psi_{c}} \left(\psi_{\text{soil},i}-\psi_{c} \right)     & \text{if } \psi_{c} \le \psi_{\text{soil},i} \le \psi_{o} \\
    \\[1pt]
    \dfrac{T}{f_w} r_i    & \text{if } \psi_{\text{soil},i} > \psi_{o}
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    In the Darcy framework, water fluxes are the product of hydraulic conductance ($k_i$) and hydraulic gradient ($\Delta\psi$).
    Although SMS does not explicitly calculate hydraulic conductance, (\ref{eq:btrwu}) can be used to define hydraulic analogs resulting from the transpiration partitioning heuristic function, 
    allowing easier comparison to the PHS root water uptake implementation.
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
    q_i &= -k_i\Delta\psi \\
    \Delta\psi &=  \psi_{c}-\psi_{\text{soil},i} \\
    k_i &= \dfrac{T}{f_w} \dfrac{r_i}{\psi_{o}-\psi_{c}} \\
    \mbox{constrained by:} \qquad
    \Delta\psi &=
    \begin{cases}
    0                          & \text{if } \psi_{\text{soil},i}<\psi_{c}  \\
    \psi_{c}-\psi_{o} & \text{if } \psi_{\text{soil},i}>\psi_{o}
    \label{kb}
    \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}\end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    
   
% Plant Hydraulics
\subsection{PHS (CLM5 default)}
    \label{sect:phs}
    \subsubsection{PHS Water stress factor}
    \label{sect:fwphs}
    
    PHS introduces a new formulation of the water stress function, $f_w$, which is based on leaf water potential ($\psi_{\text{leaf}}$) instead of soil potential (described further in Section \ref{sect:demand}). The relationship is modeled with a sigmoidal function, subject to two parameters: the water potential at 50\% loss of stomatal conductance ($\psi_{50}$) and a shape-fitting parameter ($c_k$).
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    f_{w,\text{PHS}} = 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    Utilizing leaf water potential, instead of soil water potential, for drought stress introduces a new interpretation of vegetation water stress to the model. 
    Leaf water potential is modulated by supply of sap to the leaves and by evaporative demand, as regulated by stomatal dynamics \citep{novick2016a}. 
    As a result, low soil water (bottom-up stress) induces stress due to limited water supply, but in addition, high atmospheric VPD can induce stress with the associated increases in the gradient in water potential across the plant xylem (top-down stress). 
    This latter mechanism was absent from the previous water stress function (dependent on soil water potential only), by construction.
    Given the observed increase in VPD with global warming, it appears critical to include such mechanistic dependence of water stress.
    While the Medlyn stomatal conductance model does depend on VPD, the model does not (given constant $g_1$) reflect the risk of hydraulic failure \citep{zhou2013}.
    The new stress factor formulation reflects the dual risks of soil moisture deficit and atmospheric demand on hydraulic safety \citep{williams2013}, requiring vegetation to avoid excessive xylem tension associated with risk of cavitation.

    \subsubsection{PHS Root Water Uptake}
        \label{sect:phsrwu}
    
    PHS implements an alternative to the SMS heuristic approach for root water uptake, using a mechanistic representation following Darcy's Law.
    Instead of a constant parameter ($\psi_c$) defining $\Delta\psi$, PHS implements a physical model of vegetation water potential (described in Section \ref{sect:vwp}).
    The water flux from a given soil layer is driven by the gradient between soil potential ($\psi_{\text{soil},i}$) and the water potential in the root collar ($\psi_{\text{root}}$), 
    after accounting for the effects of gravity ($\rho g z_i$, where $z_i$ is the soil layer depth).
    Hydraulic conductance across the soil and roots ($k_{sr}$) is modeled based on soil hydraulic properties and xylem vulnerability, 
    accounting for both the path across the soil matrix and through the xylem conduits (details in Appendix B).
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
    q_i &= -k_{sr,i}  \left(\psi_{\text{root}}-\psi_{\text{soil},i}+\rho g z_i\right)
    \label{phs:sink}
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}

\subsubsection{Modeling Vegetation Water Potential}
\label{sect:vwp}
  The PHS model within CLM5 uses Darcy's law to model the flow of water through the SPAC, which can be represented with an electrical circuit analogy (Figure \ref{circuit}).
  PHS solves for vegetation water potential along the path from soil-to-atmosphere.
  Vegetation water supply (root water uptake) and demand (transpiration) are both coupled to vegetation water potential, 
  such that the solution for vegetation water potential is the set of values that matches supply with demand.

  \begin{figure}[h]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=9pc]{../figs/circuit.pdf}
     \caption{Plant hydraulic circuit analog schematic}
     \label{circuit}
  \end{figure}


  PHS solves for vegetation water potential at four locations: $\psi_{\text{root}}$, $\psi_{\text{stem}}$, $\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}$, and $\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}$.
  The number of nodes is chosen as the strict minimum to allow for differences in segment parameterizations \citep{simonin2015, sperry2015}, while also conforming to existing CLM model structure (vertically discretized soil layers, 2-big-leaf).
  At each node in the circuit diagram in Figure \ref{circuit} we model water potential, and, between nodes, we resolve the flux of water based on Darcy's law. 
  Water uptake from the different soil layers is assumed to operate in parallel; a typical assumption justified by higher resistance in lateral versus central roots (e.g. \cite{williams2001}). 
  Two resistors operate in series between each $\psi_{\text{soil}}$ and $\psi_{\text{root}}$, to represent the path across the soil matrix and then through the root tissue \citep{williams1996}. 
  Specifics on the parameterization of hydraulic conductance for each segment are provided in Appendix B.1.

%PHS solution
    \subsubsection{PHS solution}
    \label{sect:solution}
    
    PHS solves for the set of vegetation water potential values ($\psi$) that matches water supply (root water uptake) to water demand (transpiration), while satisfying continuity across the four water flow segments (soil-to-root, root-to-stem, stem-to-leaf, and leaves-to-transpiration). 
    Beginning from an initial condition of $\psi$ (from the previous timestep), PHS computes the flux divergence $f$ (representing the mismatch of flow in and out of each segment) and iteratively updates $\psi$ until it reaches convergence, i.e. $f\to0$.
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} 
    \psi = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \psi_{\text{sun}} \\ 
    \psi_{\text{shade}} \\ 
    \psi_{\text{stem}} \\ 
    \psi_{\text{root}}            
    \end{array} \right]
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    f\left(\psi\right) = \left[ 
    \begin{array}{c}
    E_{sun}-q_{sun}\\
    E_{shade}-q_{shade}\\
    q_{sun}+q_{shade}-q_{stem}\\
    q_{stem}-\sum_{j=1}^n{q_{root,j}}
    \end{array} \right]
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}
    
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
    A = \dfrac{df}{d\psi}
    \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}    
    
    While $\left|f\right|>0$
    \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:iter}
    \Delta\psi &=A^{-1}f\left(\psi_i\right) \\
    \psi_{i+1}  &= \psi_i + \Delta\psi
    \end{aligned} \end{equation}
    \end{linenomath*}    
    
    The numerics are tractable because $f$ has continuous, analytical derivatives and $A$ (a 4x4 matrix with six null entries) is easy to invert when well-conditioned. Supply and demand converge, because transpiration demand decreases with more negative leaf water potentials and supply increases with more negative leaf water potentials. The PHS loop is nested within iterations for intercellular CO$_2$ concentration and leaf temperature. As described earlier, within a set of PHS iterations (\ref{eq:iter}), transpiration is assumed to be linear with $f_w$. The non-linear relationship between $f_w$ and transpiration is resolved through iteration for converging $f_w$ alongside intercellular CO$_2$. Details on the numerical implementation are provided in Appendix Section B.1.
   
%Water Supply
    \subsubsection{Water supply}
    \label{sect:supply}
    Water supply is modeled via Darcy's Law, where flux of water ($q$) is the product of the path hydraulic conductance ($k$) and the gradient in water potential ($\psi_2-\psi_1$) after accounting for gravitational potential ($\rho g \Delta z$).  
    Equation \ref{eq:darcy} represents the flow from a generic node 1 to node 2. 
    
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{equation}
     \label{eq:darcy}
     q = -k\left(\psi_2 - \psi_1 + \rho g \Delta z\right)
     \end{equation}
     \end{linenomath*}
    
    For simplicity, PHS does not represent plant tissue water storage (or capacitance, using the electrical circuit analogy), and is in line with recent supply-loss theory \citep{sperry2015}.  
    Capacitance significantly complicates the water potential solution \citep{celia1990} and is challenging to parameterize \citep{bartlett2016}. 
    However, buffering of water stress provided by tissue water storage could potentially be important especially on sub-daily timescales \citep{meinzer2009,epila2017}, 
    whereby its inclusion may be warranted in future model versions.

     Hydraulic conductance through vegetation segments is modeled following empirical xylem vulnerability curves \citep{tyree1989}, where segments lose conductance with increasing xylem tension related to cavitation and embolism \citep{holbrook2001}.
      The vulnerability curves model loss of conductance relative to maximum conductance ($k_{\text{max}}$) using two parameters: 
      $c_k$, a sigmoidal shape-fitting parameter, and $p_{50}$, the water potential at 50\% loss of segment conductance (following \cite{gentine2016}). 
     
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{equation}
     \label{eq:vulnerability}
     k = k_{\text{max}} \, 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_1}{p_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
     \end{equation}
     \end{linenomath*}
     
     Both $c_k$ and  $p_{50}$ can be estimated from field experiments \citep{sack2002}, and $p_{50}$ is available in the TRY trait database \citep{kattge2011}. 
     Parameterization based on $p_{50}$ aligns with the call for a transition to models that use a wider range of plant functional trait data in their parameterization \citep{anderegg2015a}. 
     The loss of xylem conductivity is based on lower terminal water potential ($\psi_1$) as is typical in other simplified models \citep{xu2016}, but 
     may underestimate the integrated loss of conductivity \citep{sperry2015}. 
         
     PHS models root, stem, and leaf tissue conductances according to equation \ref{eq:vulnerability}. 
     The parameterization of $k_{\text{max}}$ varies by hydraulic segment (see details in Appendix B1). 
     The conductance across the soil matrix to the root surface follows \citet{williams2001} and \citet{bonan2014}. 
     Bulk soil resistivity is based on \citet{clapp1978} as described in \citet{oleson2013}. 
     Details are provided in Appendix B1.
    
%Water demand
    \subsubsection{Water demand}

    Water demand is calculated using the Medlyn stomatal conductance model (see Section \ref{sect:gs}) modulated by the CLM water stress factor.
    As discussed earlier $f_w$ is based on leaf water potential in PHS, where stress increases as leaf water potential becomes more negative \citep{klein2014}.
    Because leaf water potential is modeled separately for sunlit and shaded leaves, $f_w$ takes on distinct sunlit and shaded values.
    
     \begin{linenomath*}
     \begin{equation}
     \begin{aligned}
     \label{eq:d1}
     f_{w,sun} &= 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}} \\
     f_{w,shade} &= 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
     \end{aligned}     
     \end{equation}
     \end{linenomath*}
     
     Shaded and sunlit leaf transpiration ($E_{\text{sun}}$, $E_{\text{shade}}$) are calculated by attenuating maximal transpiration ($E_{\text{sun,max}}$,$E_{\text{shade,max}}$) according to $f_w$. 
     $E_{\text{sun,max}}$ and $E_{\text{shade,max}}$ are calculated at the beginning of each timestep by running the stomatal conductance model with $f_w=1$.
     Equations (\ref{eq:d1}) and (\ref{eq:d2}) reflect a simplification used within iterations of the PHS module, 
     neglecting non-linear components of the relationship between stress and transpiration (described further in Section zqz).

\section{Experiment Description}
\label{sect:exp}

We use a set of four simulations to assess the impact of the plant hydrodynamics model (PHS versus SMS) on a throughfall exclusion experiment.
\begin{enumerate}
\item SMS, with ambient precipitation throughfall (AMB)
\item SMS, with 60\% of precipitation throughfall excluded (TFE)
\item PHS, AMB
\item PHS, TFE
\end{enumerate}

All four simulations use the same version of CLM5
(development version r270, www.github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/releases/tag/clm4\textunderscore 5\textunderscore 18\textunderscore r270),
which features a switch that can toggle between SMS and PHS configurations.
Simulations are run offline (uncoupled from an active atmospheric model), spanning from 2001 through 2003, utilizing the satellite phenology (SP) mode of CLM5 in which vegetation state (LAI, canopy height) is prescribed and biogeochemistry is inactive. Six-year spin-up simulations (one each for SMS and PHS) are used to create initial conditions, repeating the Ambient simulation twice. Descriptions of site characteristics, forcing data, and observational sap flux and soil moisture, can be found in \cite{fisher2007} and \cite{fisher2008}.

Informed by parameter values reported in \cite{fisher2008}, we tuned soil hydraulic parameters and throughfall exclusion rates to be in the range of observed soil moisture (Supp Fig \ref{supp:sm}).
A 972-member ensemble of simulations was used to tune the parameters for the PHS configuration to reasonably reflect sap flux observations (see Appendix \ref{ens}).

\section{Results}  
\subsection{Vegetation water potential}

    Under ambient conditions, the PHS modeled 2003 dry season (September-October-November) average sunlit leaf water potential is -1.65 MPa at midday (local time 12-14h, Figure \ref{fig:vwp}a). 
    The midday pressure drop primarily occurs between $\psi_{root}$ and $\psi_{stem}$ ($\Delta\psi$=-1.47 MPa), representing the root collar and upper stem, respectively. There is relatively little drop in root water potential between predawn and midday (-0.05MPa) and only -0.02MPa difference between stem and sunlit leaf potential at midday (and -0.01 MPa between stem and shade leaf).
    
    Under TFE, model midday leaf water potential decreases to -2.31 MPa (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}b). 
    Partitioned among the segments of the SPAC, the changes in leaf water potential (totaling -0.66MPa) due to TFE are:
    -0.44MPa soil potential,
    -0.66MPa soil-to-root,
    +0.45MPa root-to-stem, and 
    -0.001MPa stem-to-leaf.
    This comports with previous evidence that seasonal changes in hydraulic resistance are larger belowground \citep{fisher2006}.
    
    Modeled root water potential values match wet season observations, but are less negative than dry season observations under ambient conditions \citep{fisher2006}.
    Midday leaf water potential features a seasonal cycle, with lower values during the dry season (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}c).
    Modeled leaf water potential values under ambient conditions are less negative than field observations (-1.71 MPa during the wet season and -2.47 MPa during the dry season, from \cite{fisher2006}), but are within the range of observations.
    The model seems to underestimate isohydricity (which would be reflected by minimal leaf water potential drop during drought) in response to TFE, showing a significant drop in leaf water potential of 0.66MPa (dry season, 2003), whereas observations showed no significant difference \citep{fisher2006}. 

\subsection{Stress factor}
    
    Average midday stress values are comparable during the 2003 dry season (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}) between the two model configurations.
    Under ambient conditions, the average stress factor values are 0.59 and 0.54 for SMS and PHS, respectively (dry season, midday), 
    decreasing to 0.16 and 0.21, with TFE.
    While the SMS stress factor has minimal diurnal variability (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}a),
    PHS features increased stress at midday (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}b), corresponding to the drop in leaf water potential (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}b,c).
    Indeed, the PHS stress factor responds to both soil moisture and VPD (Figure \ref{fig:stress2}c,d), while SMS responds only to soil moisture (Figure \ref{fig:stress2}a,b).
    This dependence on VPD results in more wet season stress with PHS (as compared to SMS) under both ambient and TFE conditions (Figure \ref{fig:gpp}a-d).

\end{table}


\subsection{GPP and Transpiration}
    The two models predict similar GPP during the TFE simulation (2002-2003), with 1.98 kgC/m$^2$/yr for SMS and 2.00 kgC/m$^2$/yr for PHS, 
    but GPP is lower for PHS under ambient conditions (2.43 kgC/m$^2$/yr) as compared to SMS (2.73 kgC/m$^2$/yr, Figure \ref{fig:gpp}e-h).
    Seasonal variability in GPP is smaller with PHS, especially under ambient conditions. 
    The standard deviations of daily GPP (2002-2003) are 0.49 and 1.55 gC/m2/d for AMB/TFE, 
    as compared to 1.53, 2.73 gC/m2/d with SMS.
    Lower maximal photosynthesis and less variability in GPP are both related to updates to the water stress factor implemented with PHS.

    PHS has a stress response to high levels of transpiration (Supp Fig \ref{supp:tstress}c,d) due to the associated drops in leaf water potential.
    This negative feedback limits maximal transpiration and photosyntheis, while reducing variability.  
    Transpiration shows a seasonal pattern in both models (Figure \ref{fig:t}a,b), but with a larger amplitude for SMS.
    For example, under ambient conditions, the 10th and 90th percentiles for daily total transpiration with SMS are 1.65 and 4.22 mm/d ($\Delta$=2.57 mm/d).
    That range exceeds the span for PHS: 1.85 and 3.49 mm/d ($\Delta$=1.64 mm/d).
    Under ambient conditions, PHS underestimates transpiration variability as compared to sap flux observations (Figure \ref{fig:t}e).
    However PHS yields a better overall fit to the field observations, with higher R$^2$  and lower RMSE compared to SMS 
    under both ambient and TFE conditions (Figure \ref{fig:t}c-f, Table 3).

\subsection{Root water uptake: dynamics}
    Root water uptake is more sensitive to soil potential with PHS (Figure \ref{fig:rwu}),
    which follows from sharp declines in hydraulic conductance with drying.
    Hydraulic conductance decreases by approximately three orders of magnitude across the range of PHS soil potential (Supp Figure \ref{supp:cond}b).
    In contrast, the SMS-implied conductance increases with drying over most of the soil potential domain, until $\psi_{\text{soil}}$ reaches -2.5MPa, beyond which it is defined to equal 0 (Supp Figure \ref{supp:cond}a).
    Root water uptake still decreases with SMS as soils dry beyond -2.5MPa, but only because of the decrease in $\Delta\psi$ (Supp Figure \ref{supp:cond2}c).
    Whereas PHS imparts a diurnal cycle to root water uptake via dynamic root water potential, 
    the hydraulic gradient with SMS is defined by $\psi_c$, which is constant, requiring a diurnal cycle in the (implied) hydraulic conductance (Supp Figure \ref{supp:cond2}).
    
\subsection{Root water uptake: profiles}
    Overall, the two model configurations feature comparable transpiration during the dry season under ambient conditions (PHS: 28.3cm, SMS: 28.5cm).
    However they feature distinct vertical profiles, as PHS removes less water from intermediate soil layers (0.5-1.5meters) (Figure \ref{fig:qdry}d).
    SMS removes more water from these layers, due to the lower sensitivity of root water uptake to soil potential.
    Likewise, partitioning of root water uptake within the soil column is more sensitive to precipitation in PHS (Figure \ref{fig:qdry}a-c). In PHS, during the longer periods without rain, surface extraction plateaus and transpiration is fueled by the deeper soil water.
    After rain events, surface extraction renews, while at depth, root water fluxes reverse, with water deposited through root hydraulic redistribution instead of being extracted.
    Both models decrease surface extraction under TFE (Figure \ref{fig:qdry}b), but PHS has a larger compensation from below 0.2m (Figure \ref{fig:qdry}c),
    allowing more overall transpiration (14.6 vs. 10.8 cm).
    
    During the wet season PHS utilizes more water from the near-surface soil layers (Figure \ref{fig:qwet}b), 
    with zero net root water uptake below soil depth of 35.2 cm in ambient conditions (or beyond 9.6cm under TFE).
    SMS extracts 49.8\% (AMB) and 81.5\% (TFE) of total transpiration from beyond those levels (Figure \ref{fig:qwet}). 
    PHS does extract some water from beyond 35.2/9.6cm into the soil profile, but in service of hydraulic redistribution, 
    sending the extracted water deeper into the soil column.
        
\subsection{Hydraulic redistribution}
    SMS precludes hydraulic redistribution (HR) setting root water uptake to zero when reversed gradients in water potential occur (contrary to PHS).
    With PHS, HR totals to 38.9 cm under ambient conditions and 40.0 cm under TFE over the course of 2003, with the majority (28.0, 26.7 cm) of this HR occurring at night (Figure \ref{fig:hr}).
    HR occurs in both directions (Supp Fig \ref{supp:hr}), but is predominately downwards (AMB: 30.7cm, TFE: 33.8cm).
    Likewise HR occurs during both the wet and dry seasons.
    The seasonality changes with TFE, as AMB has more HR during Sept-Jan, while TFE features more HR during Feb-Apr.

\subsection{Soil moisture}
    During the dry season, SMS simulations yield much lower values for soil matric potential (Figure \ref{fig:sm}, Supp Fig \ref{supp:sm}). 
    SMS root-fraction-weighted average soil potential is -1.42 MPa under ambient conditions (dry season), compared to -0.14 MPa with PHS (average predawn root water potential).
    With TFE, SMS dry season soil potential drops to -2.51 MPa and PHS to -0.50 MPa.

    PHS better matches observations of soil moisture, with RMSE lower by up to 55\% (Figure \ref{fig:sm2}, Supp Fig \ref{supp:sm2}).
    The SMS values correspond to a significant dry bias (Figure \ref{fig:sm2}), especially in the first meter of the soil column.
    This is associated with the soil wilting parameter ($\psi_c$), which takes the value -2.5MPa for the broadleaf evergreen tropical PFT \citep{oleson2013}.
 
\subsection{Soil moisture effect on transpiration}    
    Model soil potential shows limited relationship to sap flux observations under ambient conditions (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cool}b,f), which is indicative of limited soil moisture stress.
    However, in the SMS configuration, modeled transpiration decreases strongly with more negative soil potential (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cool}a),
    biasing the model relative to observations (Fig \ref{fig:cool}a).
    
    Sap flux observations under TFE show a stronger relationship with soil potential especially with PHS (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cool}h,d).
    With SMS, the modeled attenuation of transpiration with soil potential again seems to bias modeled transpiration (Fig \ref{fig:cool}b).
    Derived from $\psi_c$, transpiration approaches zero when soil potential reaches -2.5 MPa (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cool}c).
    The two PHS simulations feature less structure in transpiration bias vs. soil potential and less bias overall (Fig \ref{fig:cool}c,d).
    
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Can modeling vegetation water potential improve the CLM?}

    In this study, we have implemented plant hydraulic theory within CLM5, 
    using dynamic vegetation water potential to modulate leaf gas exchange and root water uptake.
    PHS installs a model for predicting vegetation water potential by extending Darcy's Law through the vegetation substrate (Figure \ref{circuit}), 
    creating four new water potential prognostic variables ($\psi_{\text{root}}$, $\psi_{\text{stem}}$, $\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}$, and $\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}$).  
    The model is able to capture expected diurnal and seasonal dynamics of vegetation water potential, 
    with lower values within the stem and leaves at midday and during the dry season (Figure \ref{fig:vwp}).
    
    Beyond matching observations of leaf and stem water potentials, the ambition of plant hydraulic models is to advance the physical basis for modeling the SPAC, while improving predictions of water and carbon fluxes. 
    Following from this, the bulk of our analysis and discussion pertains to how modeling vegetation water potential can be used to improve the representations of transpiration, root water uptake, and soil moisture dynamics within the CLM. 

\subsection{Water stress and stomatal conductance}
    \label{sect:stress}
    PHS uses leaf water potential as the input to the water stress factor, 
    replacing the previous version based on soil water potential (SMS).
    Using leaf water potential permits a representation of xylem tension stress and its diurnal variations, where vegetation must limit transpiration to avoid cavitation and embolism.
    This limitation is in addition to the VPD response of the Medlyn stomatal conductance model,
    where stomatal conductance is proportional to VPD$^{-0.5}$, which optimizes carbon gain versus water losses \citep{medlyn2011}.
    Opting for xylem tension stress (PHS), in lieu of soil moisture stress (SMS), inserts an alternative physical interpretation of water stress and also yields different stress dynamics, which has significant support in the literature \citep{novick2016a,sperry2017}.
    
    Basing stress on leaf water potential imparts a diurnal cycle to the water stress factor (Figure \ref{fig:stress1}), following the midday drop in leaf water potential induced by high leaf-level VPD and photosynthesis.
    As such, water stress now depends on transpiration demand, and, in turn, leaf-level VPD and radiation (Figure \ref{fig:stress2}, Supp Fig \ref{supp:fsds}) and not only on soil moisture stress.
    The PHS water stress factor also exhibits a seasonal cycle, with lower values (indicating more stress) during the dry season.  
    However, the seasonal variation in water stress is smaller than with the control model (Figure \ref{fig:gpp}a-d).
    
    As a result, PHS (compared to SMS) features less seasonal variability in GPP and transpiration, especially under ambient conditions (Figures \ref{fig:gpp}e-h, \ref{fig:t}a,c).
    Furthermore, PHS exhibits less variability in transpiration than observations derived from sap flux velocity (Figure \ref{fig:t}e,f).
    This follows from a negative feedback on GPP induced by the PHS water stress factor.
    Conditions favoring increased GPP (e.g. more light) also increase xylem tension and stress, which opposes increases in GPP.
    This negative feedback could be loosened by adjusting parameters to increase the hydraulic safety margin, such as increasing maximum stem hydraulic conductance.
        \cite{restrepo2017} show that GPP at Caxiuan\~a is highest during the dry season, suggesting that both models fail to capture the observed GPP seasonal cycle.

    Likewise, both models produce a high bias in transpiration under TFE (Figure \ref{fig:t}a,b). 
    A previous study testing the CLM (version 3.5) with the Caxiuan\~a TFE experiment also found that the model underestimated the effect of the drought treatment  \citep{powell2013}.
    This might suggest model structural or parametrics deficiencies that are external to the water stress parameterization.
    
    Overall, PHS provides a better match to sap flux observations, featuring lower RMSE and higher correlation, especially under ambient conditions. This result should be tempered by the fact that model tuning was not symmetrical between the two configurations (see Section \ref{sect:exp}).
    However, in Section \ref{sect:smt}, we discuss further evidence that suggests that PHS provides significant improvements in modeling water stress and its effect on transpiration.
    
    
\subsection{Structural improvements in modeling root water uptake}
    In addition to modulating water stress and transpiration, vegetation water potential can be used to improve the CLM representation of root water uptake.
PHS uses dynamic root water potential ($\psi_{\text{root}}$, Figure \ref{fig:vwp}) as the sink for measuring the hydraulic gradient governing root water uptake ($\Delta\psi$).
Because SMS does not resolve water potential through the vegetation substrate, the model instead uses a constant parameter, $\psi_c$, in its definition of $\Delta\psi$.
    As such, PHS provides a critical structural improvement for modeling root water uptake, consistent with extensive evidence of dynamic vegetation water potential (e.g. \cite{fisher2006}).

    Root water uptake dynamics are driven by either changes in $\Delta\psi$, as discussed above, or by changes in hydraulic conductance, $k$. 
    PHS features mechanistic reductions in $k$ based on root xylem vulnerability and soil hydraulic properties, 
    conforming to soil-root hydraulic theory \citep{cai2014,warren2015}.
    As a result the soil-root conductance features a strong, positive relationship with soil potential, decreasing by almost three orders of magnitude as the soil dries (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cond}).
    Hydraulic conductance is not explicitly modeled with SMS, but the values implied by the transpiration partitioning function (see Section \ref{sect:smsrwu}), actually increase as soils dry over the domain of $\psi_c<\psi_{\text{soil}}<\psi_o$ (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cond}).
    
        Furthermore, whereas SMS uses a relative notion to scale uptake by root abundance (root fraction), PHS opts for an absolute measure (root area), which can better capture dynamic carbon allocation in response to drying.
    With SMS, if root mass were to double in every soil layer, the root fraction remains unchanged, yielding no advantage in accessing soil water.
    With PHS, as root area in a soil layer increases so does the hydraulic conductance, even if the layer root fraction remains constant.
    
    PHS appropriately penalizes extraction of soil water from deep in the soil column, associated with increased distance between roots, increased xylem length, and contributions from gravity (all factors not represented in SMS).
    As a result, PHS favors surface extraction when water is available (Figure \ref{fig:qwet}).
    The model can overcome these penalties, featuring compensatory root water uptake where extraction (during the dry season) from beyond 2-meter depth increases significantly in response to TFE (Figure \ref{fig:qdry}).
    Dynamic root water potential (and conductance) gives PHS more flexibility, allowing the model to switch root water uptake to the lower layers as the surface dries out.
   
     Finally, PHS eschews the unsubstantiated constraints on $\Delta\psi$ imposed by SMS ($0\ge\Delta\psi\ge\psi_c-\psi_o$, see Section \ref{sect:fwsms}).
    Allowing $\Delta\psi$ to change sign yields a representation of hydraulic redistribution, which has been observed in Amazonian forests \citep{oliveira2005}.
    
\subsection{Hydraulic Redistribution (HR)}
    Substantial HR is simulated at our test site, both upwards and downwards (Figure \ref{fig:hr}, Supp Fig \ref{supp:hr}), as has been observed in the field \citep{burgess1998}.
    Modeled HR is dominated by downward transfers, moving near-surface water from rain events deeper into the soil column and thus saving it for when it is most needed such as during the dry season.
    This would seem to convey an advantage to deep-rooted individuals, banking water for later use out of reach of shallow-rooted competitors.
    HR can offer significant water subsidies during dry periods \citep{jackson2000} and has been highlighted as an important missing feature in CLM \citep{lee2005}. We should note that observations of HR are extremely difficult and rare, and the degree to which HR actually occurs in real-world systems remains unclear. 
    Unequivocal detection of HR involves the observation of reverse flow along transport roots, typically at rates close to the detection threshold of sap flow monitoring systems. 
    
    One challenge we faced was that in an initial implementation of PHS, HR seemed to oversupply the top layer of the soil column (spanning 0 to 2 cm below the ground surface) and thus significantly degraded modeled soil evaporation (not shown). 
    To remedy this problem, we set the hydraulic conductance to zero in the uppermost soil layer, disallowing any root water uptake there.
    
    In our simulations, HR increases root water uptake by up to 52\% relative to transpiration alone (2003, TFE). 
    
    PHS naturally represents HR, as it follows directly from Darcy's Law, occurring when water potential in a given soil layer is more negative than $\psi_{\text{root}}$.
    However, it remains to be seen whether HR, as modeled in this implementation, is a feature or a liability.
    PHS may overestimate HR, given the simplified root system architecture \citep{bouda2017} 
    and the lack of an explicit representation of fine-root cavitation \citep{kotowska2015}.
    Other models, similar to the SMS paradigm, disallow HR by constraining root water uptake to be positive \citep{xu2016}.
    We view this first implementation of HR into the default versions of the CLM as a `null' hypothesis for the functioning of this process, and as a platform to allow further refinement from the plant hydraulics community. 
    Isotopologues of water could be used as a tool to further constrain this redistribution in CLM in the future. 

\subsection{Soil moisture dynamics}
    \label{sect:smt}

    Partly due to HR, vertical and temporal gradients in soil water potential are significantly reduced in PHS (Figure \ref{fig:sm}).
    This can also be attributed to the root water extraction hydraulic gradient ($\Delta\psi$), which is significantly smaller in PHS (Supp Fig \ref{supp:cond2}).
    In turn, SMS features a significant dry bias relative to soil moisture observations, especially in the first meter of the soil column.
    This indicates that SMS root water uptake is `pulling' too hard, and that $\psi_c$ is too low, at least regarding soil moisture dynamics.
    PHS reduces soil moisture RMSE by up to 55\% relative to SMS (Figure \ref{fig:sm}).
    
    In the literature, $\psi_c$ is primarily associated with its role governing the response of transpiration and photosynthesis to soil moisture \citep{powell2013,bonan2014,rogers2017}.
    We show that it likewise has significant control over soil moisture, itself. 
    Throughout the four simulations, $\psi_c$ (equals -2.5MPa) is significantly lower than $\psi_{root}$, yielding a larger hydraulic gradient, and the dry bias in soil moisture.
    Likewise, during dry periods, soil potential has a tendency to take on the specific value of $\psi_c$ over significant areas of space/time.
    Constrained to the top 2 meters of the soil column (which contains 98\% of the total root fraction, Figure \ref{roots}), 38.9\% of the space-time area in Figure \ref{fig:sm}a is within 0.1 MPa of $\psi_c$.
    This can occur even without TFE, where Soil Layer 8 (spanning 68 to 92cm below ground) spends 23.2\% of the time during 2003 within 0.1 MPa of $\psi_c$ (Supp Fig \ref{supp:sm}a) under ambient conditions.
    Through its effect on root water uptake (Equation \ref{eq:btrwu}) $\psi_c$ serves as an effective minimum soil water potential (outside of layers influenced by soil evaporation).
    In addition, due to the discontinuity of the root water uptake equation that occurs at $\psi_c$, soil water potential has a tendency to trend towards and then stick at $\psi_c$ during dry periods.
    PHS instead adopts a more physical model for root water uptake (Equation \ref{phs:sink}) that avoids this discontinuity, preserves some soil moisture variability during dry periods (Figure \ref{fig:sm}), and better conforms to hydraulic theory.
    
\subsection{The influence of soil moisture on transpiration}
    
    The stress effects of declining soil water potential seems to bias SMS predictions of transpiration relative to sap flux observations (Figure \ref{fig:cool}a,b).
    Under ambient conditions, soil water shows little relationship with sap flux observations with either model configuration (Supp Figure \ref{supp:cool}b,f),
    however SMS modeled transpiration decreases strongly in response to soil drying (Supp Figure \ref{supp:cool}a).
    This creates a bias where SMS underestimates transpiration during the drier soil conditions, 
    which is in line with \cite{bonan2014}, where the water stress factor was found to impose too much attenuation of transpiration (in CLM4.5).
    With PHS the transpiration bias does not seem to strongly depend on soil potential, while also featuring less bias overall (Figure \ref{fig:cool}c,d).
    Likewise PHS yields a stronger relationship than SMS between soil potential and sap flux observations during TFE (Figure \ref{supp:cool}d,h).
    This could indicate that PHS better models the relationship between soil potential and water stress and/or the soil moisture dynamics itself. 
    The reduction in bias introduced by the water stress function (especially as it depends on soil potential) represents a major development, given repeated calls to improve vegetation water stress in the next generation of terrestrial biosphere models \citep{powell2013,rogers2017}.

    


\subsection{Benefits and limitations of PHS}

\subsubsection{Benefits}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item parameters are better represented in trait database
    \item creates an interface to VOD data
    \item platform for testing various hydraulics hypotheses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item xylem tension and/or hydraulic cost limitation to g$_s$
        \item drought-informed dynamic allocation
    \end{itemize}
     \item improved soil moisture and transpiration dynamics (subject to asymmetrical tuning)
     \item advanced physical realism for RWU
     \begin{itemize}
         \item reflects dynamic veg water potenial
         \item responds to absolute measure of root biomass
         \item eschews constraints that on one side preclude HR and the other set an effective minimum $\psi_{soil}$
     \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item hydraulics are simplified
    \begin{itemize}
        \item no capacitance
        \item vulnerability not integrated across veg tissue or soil matrix
        \item stem-to-leaf resistance is not fully deployed
        \item simplified root system architecture
        \item but the simplifications do add up to a nice null hypothesis for further testing and yield a relatively light-weight model
    \end{itemize}
    \item uncertainty regarding the application of water stress
    \begin{itemize}
        \item we apply to $V_{\text{cmax}}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item more parameters
    \item scale mismatch to reported parameter values in trait database 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item likewise does not necessarily comport well with PFT paradigm
    \end{itemize}
    \item we don't provide a definitive assessment on model skill
    \begin{itemize}
        \item asymmetrical model tuning
        \item especially when taking into account the increased number of parameters
        \item however PHS offers better alignment with established theory and shows promising result in removing bias introduced by the water stress factor
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

    The PHS configuration of the CLM5 within the Community Earth System Model (CESM)is, to our knowledge, the first land-surface model within an ESM with a representation of plant water potential running in its default configuration. In this paper, we have described the model implementation, and illustrated a comparison of the model dynamics for a tropical rainforest site subjected to water limitation, given that prediction of rainforest responses to drought is one of the key uncertainties in the ESM predictions \citep{huntingford2013}. Overall, the new model behaviour differs from the default configuration in ways that are expected, given its structural properties, and in many cases, provides better correspondence with observations than the default structure. 
    
    In this paper, however, we did not aimed at undertaking a comprehensive assessment of which model structure performs better, given the substantial parametric uncertainty in both models, and the dependence on numerous other features of the CLM external to water stress representation that contribute to model-observation divergences - in this case in particular, the overestimation of unstressed transpiration by both versions of the model compared to the observations. 
    
    In lieu of this type of assessment, we propose that the new PHS model structure 1) is more closely aligned with known plant hydraulics theory, 2) provides significantly improved connections to real-world observational data streams (of leaf and stem water status, sap flow, percent loss conductance) and 3) represents known features of ecohydrological function that the default model cannot capture, including hydraulic redistribution, changes in the depth of water uptake with drought stress, plant embolism impacts on gas exchange and responses of water uptake to changes in leaf:root ratios. 
    
\section{Cut from other sections}
    Plant hydraulics can potentially improve model predictions of vegetation response to climate change \citep{sperry2015}, 
    especially if parameter ranges and model complexity can be constrained \citep{rogers2017}.
    Numerous site-level models have deployed plant hydraulics (e.g. \citet{williams1996,sperry1998,bohrer2005}), and studies show
    vegetation water potential can improve predictions of stomatal response to the environment \citep{sperry2017,anderegg2017},
    More recently hydraulics have been coupled to global models \citep{bonan2014,xu2016,christoffersen2016}, 
    but most Earth System Models do not provide a mechanistic representation of vegetation water dynamics.
    
  Incorporating hydraulic theory into Earth System Models is a well established ambition in the field of ecohydrology \citep{sperry2015}, supported by potential improvements in modeling mortality and productivity \citep{choat2012,mcdowell2018}.
    However, concerns exist in the literature regarding hydraulic model complexity and parameterization \citep{verhoef2014,drake2017}, 
    which led to a series of simplifications implemented in our model design (see Section 2).
    Recent work suggests model complexity can be managed, given the significant coordination of hydraulic traits \citep{bartlett2016,christoffersen2016}.
    Furthermore incorporating plant hydraulics provides access to new streams of observational data for model validation and parameterization.
    Vegetation water potential can be monitored in the field \citep{boyer1967} and has been shown to correlate with microwave remote sensing products \citep{momen2017}.
    Parameter values can be measured in the field \citep{sack2002} and are available in the TRY database \citep{kattge2011}.

Modeling stomatal conductance and photosynthesis, especially subject to water stress, is an area of ongoing research. We use the Medlyn VPD-dependence model coupled to a hydraulic stress function that attenuates $V_{\text{cmax}}$. This complies with observations \citep{lin2018,zhou2013} that stress applied through $g_1$ underestimates attenuation of photosynthesis. However, there is no direct evidence of declines in $V_{\text{cmax}}$ at the leaf level with drought \citep{flexas2006}, whereby future work may seek to represent mesophyll conductance in CLM to correct such discrepancy.
    
    The model hydraulic supply representation is simplified, to reduce the model parameter and computational burdens.
    No capacitance.
    No integration of xylem or soil conductances vulnerability, instead based on lower node.
    No hysteresis in loss of conductance, xylem instantly regain conductance upon re-wetting.
    Leaf conductance simplified.
    Soil layers fully parallel, soil potential constant each time step.
    
    Parameter uncertainty is significant.
    Notions of hydraulic architecture will never perfectly fit on this modeling scale, especially in a PFT paradigm.
    Field measurements of hydraulic traits will help constrain parameter ranges, but mostly only aboveground.
    Flux observations can help to tune stress parameters.
    Parameter estimation for root functioning is significantly more challenging, given the difficulty in underground trait observations.
    Likewise observational constraints of vertically-resolved states and fluxes underground are scarce.
    Follow-up work will be geared towards parameter estimation and assessing model skill.

\section{Appendix to Model Description}

% Details on water supply
\subsection{Details of Water Supply}

PHS resolves flow across four different segments, soil-to-root, root-to-stem, stem-to-leaf, and leaf-to-transpiration.

Stem-to-leaf. The area bases are sunlit and shaded leaf area, respectively. 
Note that gravity is assumed negligible here. 
Likewise there is no length scaling applied to maximum conductance. 
Therefore the input parameters for $k_{1,\text{max}}$ should be conductances ($s^{-1}$).

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
q_{1a} &= k_{1} \cdot \text{LAI-sun}  \cdot \left( \psi_{\text{stem}}-\psi_{\text{sun-leaf}}\right) \\
q_{1b} &= k_{1} \cdot \text{LAI-shade} \cdot  \left( \psi_{\text{stem}}-\psi_{\text{shade-leaf}}\right)
\end{aligned} \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{1} = k_{1,\text{max}} \cdot f\left(\psi_{\text{stem}}\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
f\left(\psi\right)=2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi}{p_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
\end{aligned} \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Root-to-stem. The area basis is stem area index. 
The parameter is maximum stem xylem conductivity ($K_{2,\text{max}}$).
Stem conductance ($k_2$) is the result of scaling maximum conductivity by the tree height ($h$)
and applying loss relative to maximum conductance via the vulnerability curve $f\left(\psi_{\text{root}}\right)$. 
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
q_2 = k_2 \cdot  \text{SAI}  \cdot \left( \psi_{\text{root}}-\psi_{\text{stem}}-\rho g h\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_2 = \dfrac{K_{2,\text{max}}}{h} \cdot f\left(\psi_{\text{root}}\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Soil-to-root. Area basis is RAI in soil layer $i$, which is based on the layer root fraction times the
total root area. Total root area we have as the summed stem and leaf area indices multiplied by a relative
root area parameter ($f_{\text{root}}$).
The vertical root distribution is defined by the layer root fraction ($r_i$), which follows a one-parameter 
(by PFT) power law decay following \citet{jackson1996}.

\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
q_{3,i} = k_{3,i} \cdot  \text{RAI}_i  \cdot \left( \psi_{\text{soil,i}}-\psi_{\text{root}}-\rho g z_i\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
\text{RAI}_i=f_{\text{root}} \cdot \left( \text{SAI} + \text{LAI} \right) \cdot r_i
\label{eq:rai}
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{3,i} = \dfrac{k_{r,i}+k_{s,i}}{k_{r,i}\cdot k_{s,i}}
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{r,i} = \dfrac{K_{r,\text{max}}}{l_i} f \left(\psi_{\text{soil,i}}\right)
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
l_i = z_i + x
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}
\begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
k_{s,i} = \dfrac{K_{s,i}}{d}
\end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

The conductance $k_{3,i}$ reflects two resistors in series, from soil-to-root ($k_{s,i}$) and through the
root tissue ($k_{r,i}$).
The root tissue conductance is attenuated via the vulnerability curve framework. 
The input parameter is maximum root xylem conductivity, on the basis of RAI as defined above.
The root conductivity is scaled by the conducting length, which is estimated as the sum of soil layer depth ($z_i$)
and average lateral extent ($x$, static parameter).
The soil conductivity $K_{s,i}$ is calculated from the layer soil matric potential ($\psi_s$) 
and soil properties following \citet{clapp1978} as described in \citet{oleson2013}.
The soil conductance ($k_{s,i}$) is the result of scaling the conductivity by $d$, 
 the distance between roots estimated following \citet{williams1996} and \citet{bonan2014}

The challenge here is obviously getting your head around all the parameters.

% Details on water demand
\subsection{Details of Water Demand}

The CLM5 implementation utilizes the Medlyn stomatal conductance model \citep{medlyn2011}, while also applying water stress through $V_{\text{cmax}}$.
Transpiration is calculated reflecting contributions from both stomatal conductance and leaf boundary layer conductance ($g_b$).
    \begin{equation}
    \label{suppeq:vc}
    V_{\text{cmax}} = f_w\, V_{\text{cmax,ww}} 
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
    \label{suppeq:gs}
    g_s=g_0+\left(1+\dfrac{g_1}{\sqrt{D}}\right)\dfrac{A}{C_a}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \label{suppeq:e1}
    E_{sun} &=   g_{s,sun}*\rho*\text{VPD}*lai_{sun}*\left(1+\dfrac{g_{s,sun}}{g_b}\right)^{-1} \\
    E_{shade} &=   g_{s,shade}*\rho*\text{VPD}*lai_{shade}*\left(1+\dfrac{g_{s,shade}}{g_b}\right)^{-1}
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

At the beginning of a set of PHS iterations, we solve for $E_{\text{sun,max}}$ and $E_{\text{shade,max}}$, 
by running the stomatal conductance scheme with $f_w$ set to 1 (no stress).
Within each PHS iteration, we do not resolve the full stomatal conductance scheme, 
but instead consider only the linear attenuation of stomatal conductance by $f_w$.
Transpiration is attenuated relative to the maximal values according to leaf water potential.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \label{suppeq:e2}
    E_{\text{sun}} &=   E_{\text{sun,max}}*2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}} \\
    E_{\text{shade}} &=   E_{\text{shade,max}}*2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{\text{leaf}}}{\psi_{50}}\right)^{c_k}}
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
We define $f_w$ as the ratio of attenuated stomatal conductance ($g_{s,sun}$, $g_{s,shade}$) to maximal stomatal conductance ($g_{s,sun,max}$, $g_{s,shade,max}$),
where $g_{s,sun,max}$ and $g_{s,shade,max}$ are the stomatal conductance values associated with $E_{\text{sun,max}}$ and $E_{\text{shade,max}}$.
As such, the definition in the main text (Equation \ref{eq:d1}), represents a linear simplification between $f_w$, stomatal conductance, and transpiration.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \label{supp:fw}
    f_{w,sun} &= \dfrac{g_{s,sun}}{g_{s,sun,max}}    \\
    f_{w,shade} &= \dfrac{g_{s,shade}}{g_{s,shade,max}}
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

After each PHS iteration, we compute $g_{s,sun}$ and $g_{s,shade}$ via Equations \ref{suppeq:vc} and \ref{suppeq:vc} (which involves iterating for intercellular $CO_2$ concentration).
We then update $g_{s,sun,max}$ and $g_{s,shade,max}$ to achieve consistency between equations (\ref{suppeq:e1}) and (\ref{suppeq:e2}).
At this point $g_{s,sun,max}$ and $g_{s,shade,max}$ no longer refer to the values associated with $f_w=1$, but rather also incorporate the non-linearity between $g_s$ and $f_w$.
The PHS iteration continues to convergence of $f_w$ (see Figure \ref{flowchart}).
The numerics have proven to be stable in practice, but future versions may aim to better integrate PHS within the stomatal conductance scheme to improve the coherence of Equations \ref{eq:d1} and \ref{supp:fw}.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    g_{s,sun,max} &= \dfrac{g_{s,sun}}{f_{w,sun}} \\
    g_{s,shade,max} &= \dfrac{g_{s,shade}}{f_{w,shade}} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

\subsection{Details of Water Potential Solution}


The continuity of water flow through the system yields four equations
   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   E_{sun}&=q_{1a}\\
   E_{shade}&=q_{1b}\\
   q_{1a}+q_{1b}&=q_2\\
   q_2&=\sum_{i=1}^{nlevsoi}{q_{3,i}}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

We seek the set of vegetation water potential values (four unknowns), 

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \psi=\left[ \begin {array}{c} 
   \psi_{sunleaf}\cr\psi_{shadeleaf}\cr\psi_{stem}\cr\psi_{root}
   \end {array} \right] 
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

that satisfies these equations, as forced by the soil moisture and atmospheric state. 

Each flux on the schematic can be represented in terms of the relevant water potentials. 

Defining the transpiration fluxes:


   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   E_{sun} &= E_{sun,max} \cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{sunleaf}}{p50_e}\right)^{c_k}} \\
   E_{shade} &= E_{shade,max} \cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{shadeleaf}}{p50_e}\right)^{c_k}} 
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Defining the water supply fluxes:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   q_{1a}&=k_{1a,max}\cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{stem}}{p50_1}\right)^{c_k}} \cdot\mbox{LAI}_{sun}\cdot\left(\psi_{stem}-\psi_{sunleaf} \right) \\
   q_{1b}&=k_{1b,max}\cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{stem}}{p50_1}\right)^{c_k}}\cdot\mbox{LAI}_{shade}\cdot\left(\psi_{stem}-\psi_{shadeleaf} \right) \\
   q_2&=\dfrac{k_{2,max}}{z_2} \cdot 2^{-\left(\dfrac{\psi_{root}}{p50_2}\right)^{c_k}} \cdot SAI \cdot \left( \psi_{root} - \psi_{stem} - \Delta \psi_z  \right) \\
   q_{soil}&=\sum_{i=1}^{nlevsoi}{q_{3,i}}=\sum_{i=1}^{nlevsoi}{k_{3,i}\cdot RAI\cdot\left(\psi_{soil,i}-\psi_{root} + \Delta\psi_{z,i} \right)}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

We're looking to find the vector $\psi$
that fits with soil and atmospheric forcings while satisfying water flow continuity. 
Due to the model non-linearity, we use a linearized explicit approach, iterating with Newton's method. 
The initial guess is the solution for $\psi$ (vector) from the previous time step. 
The general framework, from iteration $m$ to $m+1$ is:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \begin{aligned}
   q^{m+1}&=q^m+\dfrac{\delta q}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi \\
   \psi^{m+1}&=\psi^{m}+\Delta\psi
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

So for our first flux balance equation, at iteration $m+1$, we have:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   E_{sun}^{m+1}=q_{1a}^{m+1}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Which can be linearized to:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   E_{sun}^{m}+\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi=q_{1a}^{m}+\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

And rearranged to be:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi=E_{sun}^{m}-q_{1a}^{m}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

And for the other 3 flux balance equations:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \begin{aligned}
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta E_{sha}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi&=E_{sha}^{m}-q_{1b}^{m} \\
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi&=q_{1a}^{m}+q_{1b}^{m}-q_2^{m} \\
   \dfrac{\delta q_{soil}}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}\Delta\psi&=q_2^{m}-q_{soil}^{m}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Putting all four together in matrix form:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \left[ \begin {array}{c}
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi} \cr
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sha}}{\delta\psi} \cr
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta\psi} \cr
   \dfrac{\delta q_{soil}}{\delta\psi}-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta\psi}
   \end {array} \right]
   \Delta\psi=
   \left[ \begin {array}{c}
   E_{sun}^{m}-q_{1a}^{m} \cr
   E_{sha}^{m}-q_{1b}^{m} \cr
   q_{1a}^{m}+q_{1b}^{m}-q_2^{m} \cr
   q_2^{m}-q_{soil}^{m}
   \end {array} \right]
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Now to expand the left-hand side, from vector $\psi$ to the four distinct plant water potential nodes, noting that many derivatives are zero (e.g. $\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta\psi_{sha}}=0$)

Introducing the notation:
$A\Delta\psi=b$

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \Delta\psi=\left[ \begin {array}{c}
   \Delta\psi_{sunleaf} \cr
   \Delta\psi_{shadeleaf} \cr
   \Delta\psi_{stem} \cr
   \Delta\psi_{root}
   \end {array} \right] 
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   A=
   \left[ \begin {array}{cccc}
   \dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{sun}}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sun}}{\delta \psi_{sun}}&0&\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&0\cr
   0&\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{sha}}-\dfrac{\delta E_{sha}}{\delta \psi_{sha}}&\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&0\cr
   -\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{sun}}&
   -\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{sha}}&
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{stem}}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1a}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}-\dfrac{\delta q_{1b}}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&
   \dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{root}}\cr
   0&0&-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{stem}}&\dfrac{\delta q_{soil}}{\delta \psi_{root}}-\dfrac{\delta q_2}{\delta \psi_{root}}
   \end {array} \right]
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   b=
   \left[ \begin {array}{c}
   E_{sun}^{m}-q_{b1}^{m} \cr
   E_{sha}^{m}-q_{b2}^{m} \cr
   q_{b1}^{m}+q_{b2}^{m}-q_{stem}^{m} \cr
   q_{stem}^{m}-q_{soil}^{m}
   \end {array} \right]
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

Now we compute all the entries for $A$ and $b$ based on the soil moisture and maximum transpiration forcings and can solve to find:

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \Delta\psi=A^{-1}b
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

   \begin{linenomath*} \begin{equation} 
   \psi_{m+1}=\psi_m+\Delta\psi
   \end{equation} \end{linenomath*}

We iterate until $b\to 0$, signifying water flux balance through the system. The result is a final set of water potentials ( $\psi_{root}$, $\psi_{xylem}$, $\psi_{shadeleaf}$, $\psi_{sunleaf}$) satisfying non-divergent water flux through the system. 

\subsection{Parameter tuning exercise}
\label{ens}

We used a factorial design to create 972 ensemble members based on the parameter values below.
We ran PHS simulations under both AMB and TFE conditions.
All simulations used the same initial conditions, which were the result of a previous simulation.
We evaluated the ensemble members based on the fit to sap flux observations, selecting that which
 maximized $R^2_{amb}+R^2_{tfe}-RMSE_{amb}-RMSE_{tfe}$ (Supp Fig \ref{supp:ens}).

Stem conductivity, $k_{\text{max}}$: 2e-8, 4e-8, 8e-8 s$^{-1}$ \\
Root conductivity, $k_{\text{r,max}}$: 2e-9, 6e-8, 18e-9 s$^{-1}$ \\
Root and stem vulnerability $\psi_{50}$: -1.75, -2.25, -2.75 MPa \\
Stomatal $\psi_{50}$: above plus either 0 or 0.5MPa \\
Vulnerability shape parameter, $c_k$: 2.95, 3.95, 5.45 (unitless) \\
Medlyn slope, $g_1$: 6, 7 kPa$^{0.5}$ \\
Rooting depth parameter, $\beta$: 0.95, 0.98, 0.993 (unitless)
