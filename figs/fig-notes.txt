figure 2: a typical day
  - purpose: situate reader in the model, show vwp
  - absolute values about correct
       . comes from p50
  - sequenced, but very small pressure drop stem-to-leaf
  - no capacitance, clear from the sharp corners at sunrise/set
  - tfe causes lower water potentials
       (1) predawn potentials lower
       (2) root drop much bigger
       (3) stem drop bigger, but change smaller than root change
  - evidence of regulation
       . flatter curve at midday


figure 3: conductance curves
  - purpose: demonstrate gradient extraction
  AMB
  - phs off has higher variance relative to median
  - phs off has relatively more conductance in lower layers
  - phs on has layer 1 nuked
  TFE
  - phs on variance increases
  - phs off still has much more conductance in lower layers
